introduction 

events with isolated lepton pairs from hadron collisions are very rare in the 
standard model sm but appear very naturally in many new physics scenarios in particular they have been proposed as signatures of supersymmetry susy universal 
extra dimensions pair production of fermionic partner of the top quark 
heavy majorana neutrinos and resonances as predicted in theories 
with warped extra dimensions in this paper we describe searches for new physics 
with isolated dileptons ee and missing transverse energy 
etmiss and hadronic jets our choice of signal regions is driven by two simple observations first astrophysical evidence for dark matter suggests that we concentrate on 
final states with etmiss second observable new physics signals with large cross sections are 





introduction 

likely to be produced by strong interactions and we thus expect significant hadronic activity in conjunction with the two leptons beyond these simple guiding principles 
our searches are as independent of detailed features of new physics models as possible 
the results are based on data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 
collected in pp collisions at energy of tev by the compact muon 
solenoid cms experiment at the large hadron collider lhc in 



the cms detector 

coordinate system is employed by the cms experiment with the origin at 
the nominal interaction point the pointing to the centre of the lhc and the 
pointing up perpendicular to the lhc plane the polar angle is measured from the 
positive and the azimuthal angle is measured in the xy plane the pseudorapidity 
is defined as ln tan 

the central feature of the cms apparatus is superconducting solenoid of internal diameter in length providing an axial field of within the field volume 
are several particle detection systems which each feature cylindrical geometry covering 
the full azimuthal range from silicon pixel and strip tracking detectors 
provide measurements of charged particle trajectories and extend to pseudorapidity of 
homogeneous crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ecal and sampling 
hadronic calorimeter hcal surround the tracking volume and provide 
energy measurements of electrons photons and hadronic jets up to an ironquartz fiber hadronic calorimeter which is also part of the hcal system is located in 
the forward region defined by muons are measured in the pseudorapidity 
range of with detection planes made of three technologies drift tubes cathode 
strip chambers and resistive plate chambers these are instrumented outside of the magnet coil within the steel return yoke the cms detector is nearly hermetic allowing for 
energy balance measurements in the plane transverse to the beam direction 
trigger system is designed to select the most interesting pp collision events for use in physics 
analysis detailed description of the cms detector can be found elsewhere 





this paper is organized as follows the cms detector is briefly described in section 
the reconstruction of leptons etmiss and jets at cms is summarized in section section 
describes our search regions we perform separate searches based on leptonic and hadronic 
triggers in order to cover wider region in the parameter space of new physics electron 
and muon triggers allow for searches that require less hadronic energy in the event while 
hadronic triggers allow inclusion of lower transverse momentum pt electrons and muons 
as well as hadronic decays in the final state the dominant backgrounds for all three 
searches are estimated from data as discussed in section systematic uncertainties on the 
predicted number of signal events and results of these searches are discussed in sections 
and we conclude with discussion on how to use our results to constrain wide variety 
of new physics models in section 



reconstruction of leptons missing energy and jets 





muon candidates are required to be successfully reconstructed using two algorithms 
one in which tracks in the silicon detector are matched to consistent signals in the calorimeters and muon system and another in which simultaneous global fit is performed to hits 
in the silicon tracker and muon system the track associated with the muon candidate 
is required to have minimum number of hits in the silicon tracker have 
global fit including minimum number of hits in the muon detectors and have calorimeter 
energy deposits consistent with originating from minimum ionizing particle 
electron candidates are reconstructed starting from cluster of energy deposits in 
the ecal which is then matched to hits in the silicon tracker selection using electron 
identification variables based on shower shape and matching is applied to 
the reconstructed candidates the criteria are optimized in the context of the inclusive 
measurement and are designed to maximally reject electron candidates from 
qcd multijet production while maintaining approximately efficiency for electrons 
from the decay of bosons electron candidates within of 
muon are rejected to remove electron candidates due to muon bremsstrahlung and finalstate radiation electron candidates originating from photon conversions are suppressed 
by looking for partner track and requiring no missing hits for the track fit in the inner 
layers of the tracking detectors 
hadronic candidates are identified starting with hadronic jet clustered from 
the particles reconstructed using the reconstruction algorithm 
the charged track within cone of around the jet axis is 
required to have pt gev variable size cone of is then defined 
around this track and the boosted products are expected to be confined within 
this narrow cone only candidates with one or three charged hadrons in this cone are 
selected the discrimination between hadronic decays and generic qcd jets is based on 
an ensemble of five neural networks each of which has been trained to identify one of the 
five main hadronic modes using the kinematics of the reconstructed charged and 
neutral pions 
all lepton candidates are required to have and be consistent with originating 
from the same interaction vertex charged leptons from the decay of bosons as well 
as the new physics we are searching for are expected to be isolated from other activity 
in the event we calculate relative measure of this isolation denoted as reliso this 
quantity is defined as the ratio of the scalar sum of transverse track momenta and transverse calorimeter energy deposits within cone of around the lepton candidate 
direction at the origin to the transverse momentum of the candidate the contribution 
from the candidate itself is excluded 
in order to suppress the background due to dileptons originating from the same jet 
we require that selected dileptons have minimum invariant mass of gev this helps to 
keep dileptons uncorrelated with respect to their reliso observables which is feature we 
exploit in the analysis we also remove events with third lepton of opposite sign and same 
flavour as one of the two selected leptons if the invariant mass of the pair is between 

and gev this requirement further reduces an already small background contribution 
from wz and zz production 
jets and etmiss are reconstructed based on the technique desribed in 
for jet clustering we use the algorithm with the distance parameter 
jets are required to pass standard quality requirements to remove those 
consistent with calorimeter noise jet energies are corrected for residual nonuniformity 
and nonlinearity of the detector response derived using collision data we require jets 
to have transverse energy above gev and to be within we define the ht 
observable as the scalar sum of the pt of all such jets with to the nearest lepton 
passing all our requirements 



search regions 

the searches discussed in this paper employ two different trigger strategies electron and 
muon triggers in one case and ht triggers in the other the leptonic triggers allow for lower 
ht requirements while the ht triggers allow for lower lepton pt as well as final states 
with hadronic decays the motivation for covering the widest possible phase space in this 
search can be illustrated by an example of susy cascade shown in figure naturally 
giving rise to jets etmiss and leptons charged gaugino 
lightest supersymmetric particle lsp neutralino the mass difference between the 
and the charged gaugino typically arbitrary defines the amount of hadronic 
activity one may expect in the event the mass difference between the gaugino and 
neutralino influences the lepton pt spectrum depending on the nature of the chargino and 
neutralino their mass difference can be either arbitrary wino and bino or typically 
small higgsinos moreover there are number of ways to generate large production 
asymmetry between and leptons which motivates us to look specifically for events 
with 





figure an example of process involving the production and decays of susy particles which 
gives rise to two prompt leptons jets and missing transverse energy 



searches using lepton triggers 

we start with baseline selection inspired by our published tt or 
cross section measurement 
events are collected using single and dilepton triggers the detailed implementation of 
these triggers evolved throughout the period as the lhc instantaneous 
luminosity was increasing trigger efficiencies are measured from pure lepton sample 
collected using decays from data the efficiency to trigger 
on events with two leptons with and pt gev one of which also has pt 
gev is very high for example the trigger efficiency for an event passing the 
baseline selection described below is estimated to be 
one of the electrons and muons must have pt gev and the second one must have 
pt gev both leptons must be isolated the isolation requirement is based on the 
reliso variable introduced earlier we require reliso for leptons of pt gev 
and the isolation sum the numerator of the reliso expression to be less than gev 
for pt gev 
we require the presence of at least two reconstructed jets implying ht gev 
finally we require the missing transverse energy etmiss gev ee and or etmiss 
gev this defines our baseline selection 
following the guiding principles discussed in the introduction we define two search regions the first has high etmiss etmiss gev the second has high ht ht gev 
these etmiss and ht values were chosen to obtain an sm background expectation in simulation of of an event in either of the two overlapping search regions 
figure shows the ht versus etmiss scatter plot for the baseline selection indicating 
the etmiss and ht requirements for the two search regions via horizontal and vertical 
lines respectively figure left shows three events red dots in the baseline region 
one of which barely satisfies ht gev but fails the etmiss gev requirement 





in the following we describe the search regions explored by each trigger strategy as 
reference point we use point in the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model cmssm defined with the model parameters 
gev gev and gev is one of the common 
cmssm reference points used in cms across many analyses as the abbreviation suggests 
provides squarks and gluinos with relatively low masses and thus has large production cross section it is beyond the exclusion reach of the searches performed by lep 
and tevatron but it has recently been excluded by searches with atlas and cms 
concurrently with this one nonetheless we continue to use as it provides common 
model for which to compare our sensitivity with that of other analyses aside from the 
point several sm simulation samples are used to both validate and complement various background estimation methods that are based on the data itself these samples rely 
on either pythia or madgraph for event generation and 
for simulation of the cms detector samples used include tt 
ww wz zz and qcd multijet production nlo cross 
sections are used for all samples except for qcd multijet production

events with the expected signal distribution for the three observed events all scatter in the 
lower left corner of the plot right scatter plot of the background in data when only one of the 
two leptons is required to be isolated 

in contrast most of the signal from typical supersymmetry models tends to pass both of 
these requirements as is visible in the expected signal distribution overlaid in figure 
left backgrounds to this analysis are dominated by events with jets mimicking leptons 
as discussed in section requiring only one of the two leptons to be isolated thus allows 
us to increase the background statistics in order to display the expected distribution of 
sm background events in the etmiss ht plane as shown in figure right backgrounds 
clearly cluster at low etmiss and low ht with slightly more than half of the events failing 
both the etmiss and ht selections moreover comparing the left and right plots in figure 
indicates that the lepton isolation requirement on both leptons versus only one lepton 
reduces the backgrounds by roughly factor of ten 


searches using hadronic triggers 

hadronic triggers allow us to explore the phase space with electrons and muons as 
well as final states with hadronic decays we allow muons electrons with pt as low as 
gev and restrict ourselves to with visible transverse momentum gev where 
refers to hadronic candidates only all leptons must be isolated with reliso 
for the ee and final states we require at least two jets ht gev and 
miss 
et gev as backgrounds from qcd multijet production are significant for we 
increase the etmiss and ht requirements to etmiss gev and ht gev in the 
and final states

background estimation 

standard model sources of dilepton events with both leptons coming from 
or decay are very small in our data sample predictions of the 
combined yields for qq wz and zz double qq double 
parton scattering qq ttw and www comprise no more than few percent 
of the total background in any of the final states considered as these processes have never 
been measured in collisions and their background contributions are very 
small we evaluate them using simulation assigning systematic uncertainty the 
background contribution from pp where the decays leptonically and the photon 
converts in the detector material giving rise to an isolated electron is also estimated from 
simulation and found to be negligible all other backgrounds are evaluated from data as 
discussed below 
backgrounds in all of our searches are dominated by one or two jets mimicking the 
lepton signature such lepton candidates can be genuine leptons from decays 
electrons from unidentified photon conversions muons from meson decays in flight hadrons 
reconstructed as leptons or jet fluctuations leading to hadronic signatures we will refer 
to all of these as leptons from gauginos etc the signal we are 
searching for will be referred to as 
the dominant background contribution is from events with one lepton jets and 
miss 
et mostly with one lepton from the decay and second lepton from the decay 
of particle these events contain one prompt and one fake lepton and 
are estimated via two different techniques described in sections and while both 
techniques implement an extrapolation in lepton isolation they differ in the assumptions 
made both techniques lead to consistent predictions as described in section 







ing additional confidence in the results backgrounds with two fake leptons are generally 
smaller except in the final state with two hadronic leptons where the dominant background source is qcd multijet production contributions due to fake are estimated 
using an extrapolation from to identification as described in section 
for the ee and final states electron charge misreconstruction due to hard 
bremsstrahlung poses another potentially important background as there are significant 
ee and contributions especially from where both from the top 
quarks decay leptonically this is discussed in section 
searches using lepton triggers 

contributions from fake leptons are estimated using the tl 
method in this method the probability for lepton passing loose selections to 
also pass the tight analysis selections is measured in qcd multijet events as function of 
lepton pt and the key assumption of the method is that is approximately universal 
it is the same for all jets in all event samples tests of the validity of this assumption 
are described below 
the main difference between the tight and loose lepton selections is that the requirement on the reliso variable defined in section is relaxed from reliso to 
reliso other requirements that are relaxed are those on the distance of closest 
approach between the lepton track and the beamline impact parameter and in the case 
of muons the selection on the of the muon track fit 
the quantity is measured in sample of events with at least one 
jet satisfying pt gev and well separated from the lepton candidate we 
refer to this jet as the we reduce the impact of electroweak background 
tt by excluding events with candidates events with etmiss gev and events 
where the transverse mass mt of the lepton and the etmiss is greater than gev studies 
based on simulation indicate that this procedure results in an unbiased estimate of up 
to lepton pt gev at higher transverse lepton momenta the remaining electroweak 
contributions in the sample have significant effect thus is measured only up to 
pt gev it is taken to be constant at higher transverse momenta as suggested by 
simulation studies 
the level of universality of is tested with different jet samples two types of tests 
are relevant and both involve the parent jet from which the lepton originates the first 
test explores the sensitivity to the pt and the second test explores the sensitivity to 
the content 
sensitivity to jet pt stems from the fact that the probability for lepton of given 
pt to pass the reliso selection depends on the pt of the parton from which the lepton 
originates to be explicit gev lepton originating from gev quark is less likely 
to pass our reliso requirement than the same lepton originating from gev quark 
the heavy flavour sensitivity can be traced to semileptonic decays which are source of 
leptons in bottom and charm jets but not in and gluon jets 
to test the jet pt dependence we select loose leptons in events with the above 
varying jet pt threshold since these events are mostly qcd dijets the pt of the

figure electron left and muon right tl probability computed from qcd multijet 
events with different requirements on the minimum pt of the the probabilities shown are 
projections of the function pt onto the pt axis 

is good measure of the pt of the jet from which the lepton originates we weight each 
event by measured as described above requiring the to have pt gev 
we then sum the weights and compare the sum to the number of observed leptons passing 
tight requirements varying the minimum pt requirement from to gev we 
find the observed yield to differ from the predicted yield by and 
for muons electrons in this test the percentages here as well as throughout this section 
refer to observed this jet pt dependence can also 
be seen in figure where we show calculated using different thresholds to 
test the dependence we repeat the exercise requiring that the be 
above pt gev and be jet in which we find secondary vertex well 
separated from the interaction point consistent with decay by applying the 
tag on the the sample of jets from which the lepton originates is enriched in heavy 
flavours introducing this tag we find the observed yield to differ from that predicted by 
for muons electrons we have thus shown that applying an obtained 
without requirement to sample with such requirement leads to modest 
difference between observed and predicted this validates our assumption that the tl 
method is flavour universal 
to predict the background from prompt lepton jets events in signal region the 
tl probability is applied to sample of dilepton events satisfying all the signal selection 
requirements but where one of the leptons fails the tight selections and passes the loose 
ones each event is weighted by the factor where is the 
probability for the loose lepton in the event the background contribution from this source 
is then estimated by summing the weights of all such events 
the sum also includes the contribution from backgrounds with two fake leptons 
however these are double counted because in the case of two fake leptons passing loose 









search using hadronic triggers electrons and muons 

as described in section hadronic triggers allow us to explore the phase space with lowpt leptons however lowering the lepton pt is expected to increase the relative contribution 
of events with two fake leptons as shown below this background now constitutes roughly 
of the total background as compared to only few percent for the thresholds 





requirements there are two combinations with one lepton passing the tight selections the 
background contribution with two fake leptons is estimated separately by selecting events 
where both leptons pass the loose requirements but fail the tight requirements each event 
in this sample is weighted by the product of the two factors of corresponding to 
the two leptons in the event and the sum of weights is used to estimate the background 
with two fake leptons 
the total background from events with one or two fake leptons is then obtained as 
in kinematic regions of interest for this search is typically more than one order 
of magnitude smaller than indicating that the main background contribution is from 
one prompt lepton and one fake lepton 
the method has been tested on simulated and jets events in these tests 
we use measured from qcd simulation events to predict the number of 
dilepton events in these samples in the simulation sample we find that the observed 
yield differs from the prediction for the baseline selection by fake muons and 
fake electrons observed and predicted yields in this test are consistent with each other 
at the confidence level cl because the simulation statistics are modest the same 
level of agreement is also found for the two search regions in the jets case the 
ratio of predicted events to observed is for fake electrons the statistics for fake 
muons are not sufficient to draw any definitive conclusions based on these studies as 
well as the dependence on pt and composition discussed above we 
assign systematic uncertainty on the ratio observed and 
hence on the estimation of backgrounds due to fake leptons in addition to this systematic 
uncertainty the method has significant statistical uncertainties based on the number of 
events in the samples to which the tl probability is applied we find events in these 
samples for the etmiss gev ht gev search regions the resulting background 
estimates in the two regions are and events respectively including only 
statistical uncertainties 
as an additional we determine the background estimate and observed 
yields in the baseline region we estimate events from background due 
to fake leptons alone and after all backgrounds are taken into account 
the uncertainties here are statistical and systematic respectively the composition of the 
total background is estimated to be events with one two fake leptons 
due to charge misidentification and irreducible background for which both leptons are 
isolated leptons from leptonic or decay as mentioned in section there are events 
observed in the baseline region in good agreement with the background estimate applying 
etmiss gev or ht gev increases the fraction of events with one fake lepton but 
statistical uncertainties on the individual components of the background estimate are too 
large to meaningfully quantify the change in the relative contributions of the components 





in the search regions for the leptonic trigger analysis this motivates the development of 
method exclusively dedicated to predicting and understanding the qcd background with 
two fake leptons 
at the same time increasing the ht requirement to gev as driven by the hadronic 
trigger thresholds reduces the expected background to only few percent of the 
total background the background with one fake lepton is now reduced to tt and singlet processes where the fake lepton is due mostly to semileptonic decays therefore we 
tailor the method for estimating the background with one fake lepton to these expectations 
the method is similar to the tl technique but has number of important differences that 
are discussed further below 
for this analysis the estimation of the background with fake leptons starts with an 
evaluation of background events with two fake leptons and then proceeds with an estimation 
of the contribution of events with only one such lepton 
first we define preselection control sample of events from the ht data 
stream with at least two dileptons and with all event selection requirements 
applied except for those related to etmiss and isolation we find ee and 
events of this type the large asymmetry between muons and electrons is mostly due to 
differences in the corresponding pt thresholds of and gev respectively in addition 
identification of electrons within jets is less efficient than that for muons 
the preselection control sample is dominated by qcd multijet production studies 
based on simulation suggest that we should attribute about of the preselection yields 
to tt contamination while attributing much smaller fraction to 
the contribution from events with two fake leptons to the signal region is estimated by 
assuming that the three requirements reliso for each lepton and etmiss gev 
are mutually independent and hence the total efficiency can be 
written in the factorized form iso iso this assumption has been verified 
both in simulation and directly in data with simulation it is straightforward to prove the 
principle in the nominal preselection region because we can safely measure the efficiencies in 
dedicated qcd sample where we know all leptons can be considered background no 
contamination from prompt leptons exists in data the contribution from prompt leptons 
is and therefore some extra selection requirements are necessary to isolate 
qcd enriched control sample 
we validate the factorized expression for in two steps in data first we demonstrate that the selection requirement on reliso is independent for each lepton we begin 
by relaxing the ht selection to gev and add events collected with leptonic triggers 
to gain more statistics we then require etmiss gev to suppress events with leptonic 
decays figure left shows that the efficiency can be squared to obtain 
the efficiency thus validating the assumption that the reliso observable is 
uncorrelated between the two fake leptons and the efficiencies can be factorized in the 
second step we demonstrate that the etmiss and reliso selection requirements are mutually 
independent to accomplish this in data we maintain ht above gev but we include 
events to increase statistics to suppress the contributions from events with 
leptonic decays we modify the selection requirement on the lepton impact

ter from the nominal mm to mm figure right shows that the 
reliso selection efficiency for muons and electrons remains constant as function of the 
etmiss selection requirement the dashed lines represent the polynomial fits to 
the efficiency measurements made in the control region for muons and electrons respectively for completeness we also show the obvious bias arising when the impact parameter 
requirement is inverted to mm to enrich the sample with leptonic decays 
it is important to note that no attempt is made to apply the reliso selection efficiency 
measured in the control region defined by mm to the above formula for this 
control region is only used to demonstrate the stability of the reliso selection efficiency 
with respect to the etmiss requirement the actual values of iso and iso are measured in 
the nominal preselection region mm where we assume this stability and hence 
factorization remains valid for events with two fake leptons 
having validated the selection factorization hypothesis we proceed to measure the 
isolation and etmiss selection efficiencies one at time in the preselection control sample 
where we obtain iso iso uncertainties quoted are statistical only as before we suppress leptonic decays to reduce 
possible biases we accomplish this by requiring either etmiss gev or reliso 
when measuring iso iso or the appropriate product of these efficiencies is then 
applied to the event counts observed in the preselection control sample leading to the 
background estimate of events uncertainties here are statistical and 
systematic respectively 
the systematic uncertainties quoted above have two dominant sources one is due 











to limited statistics in simulation and data when validating that the three requirements 
are indeed independent we take the statistical precision of this as our 
systematic uncertainty on the method the other dominant source of systematic uncertainty can be attributed to the inability of the inverted selection requirements on etmiss and 
reliso to fully suppress contributions from leptonic decays tt while 
measuring iso iso and studies based on simulation suggest that the bias overestimate can be as large as mostly via bias in measuring iso conservatively we 
do not correct for the possible bias but take it as systematic uncertainty we thus arrive 
at systematic uncertainty on the estimate of backgrounds due to events with two 
fake leptons by adding these two effects in quadrature in addition we verified in simulation that the techniques used to suppress leptonic decays inversion of the etmiss and 
reliso requirements do not alter or bias the selection efficiencies for fake leptons 
it is worth mentioning that this method of evaluating background with two fake leptons does not require any reweighting of measured efficiencies the average efficiencies 
are obtained from subset of the preselection sample and then applied 
directly to the preselection sample as whole to derive the prediction for the number of 
events with two fake leptons in the signal region 
next we proceed with estimating the contribution of backgrounds with single 
misidentified lepton we start from control sample to be further referred 
to as sideband and use the isolation selection efficiency for jets referred to as 
to predict event counts in the signal region the sideband control sample contains events 
passing all signal selection criteria except one of the two leptons is now required to have 
reliso to begin we count the number of events in this sample ee 
and the last lepton indicating which one in the pair is then we 
estimate the contribution of the background with two fake leptons to the sideband sample 
using the efficiencies quoted above from the factorization procedure for example for the 
dimuon channel the contribution to the sideband from events with two fake leptons is 
preselected iso iso the resulting yield estimates for events with two 
fake leptons are ee and after subtracting this contribution the remaining yields in the sideband are consistent with simulation predictions 
assuming that only tt and contribute this remaining 
sideband yield after subtraction is then scaled by an appropriate factor determined using 
the method as described below 
the method relies on the basic premise that events with one fake 
lepton can be attributed to tt production with one prompt lepton from leptonic decay 


and the second fake lepton from decay the efficiencies iso and iso are 
thus defined as the probabilities of muon or electron from decay to pass 
the reliso selection these efficiencies can be measured in data using appropriately 


selected events from bb production to determine iso and iso we select bb enriched 
control sample by requiring one and one lepton candidate in addition 
we require ht gev to arrive at pt spectrum similar to that expected 
for the tt background in the search to reduce the bias from leptonic or decays we 
furthermore require etmiss gev and mt gev and veto events with two leptons 

forming mass within gev of the mass of the boson approximately of the leptons 
in this sample are from semileptonic decay 
control sample differs sufficiently from the expected tt 
we find that the resulting bb 
background in both lepton kinematics and jet multiplicity njets to warrant corrections 
we therefore measure the reliso distribution in the bb control sample in data in bins of 
lepton pt and njets and reweight these distributions using event probabilities njets 
derived from simulation sample the resulting reweighted reliso distributions for 
these three samples are overlaid in figure for muons left and electrons right the

we probed four different potential sources of systematic uncertainties in the method and added their contributions in quadrature to arrive at total systematic 

uncertainty on the efficiency of for electrons muons the largest contribution 
to this uncertainty is due to the statistical precision with which the method in simulation 
is verified other potential sources of systematic errors were found to give subdominant 

contributions we evaluated the sensitivity of the measured to the choice of the ht 
requirement in the range from to gev when selecting the bb control sample in

region to be twice as large as predicted from mc with an of the one 
measured in the bb control sample finally we used the mc to estimate the change in 

for different of the bb control sample we then multiply the sideband yield

search using hadronic triggers and 

simulation studies show clearly that the largest source of background for the channels 
is due to fake leptons we estimate this background using the same tl 
method as was used for fake leptons in section except that for the selection we 
loosen the identification instead of the isolation to be specific part of the discrimination 
between hadronic decays and generic qcd jets is based on five neural networks trained 
to identify different hadronic decay modes the neural network requirements are used 
for the tight but not the loose selection 
as in section in order to predict the number of events from fake we measure 
the ratio in bins of and pt on average where the 
uncertainty is statistical only this is measured using control sample with ht 
gev and etmiss gev the ht requirement results in hadronic activity similar 
to our signal region while the etmiss requirement reduces contributions from plus 
jets and tt resulting in control region that is dominated by qcd multijet production 
the expected number of background events is estimated by selecting and 
events where the candidates pass the loose selection but fail the tight selection we find 
and such events respectively in these three channels for the and channels 
these events are weighted by the corresponding factors of while for the 
channel each event is weighted by the product of two such factors one corresponding to 
each of the two leptons in the event 
we perform two types of validation of this background estimate first we compare 
observation and prediction in the signal region for simulation second we compare observation and prediction in data after relaxing the ht selection from gev to gev 
and removing the etmiss requirement in simulation the contribution of represents less 
than of events with two isolated leptons and ht gev table presents 
both of these validations of the background estimation technique we find good agreement 
between the observation and prediction in all channels in data and in the simulation 





arrive at as the estimate of the contribution of events with one fake 
lepton to the total background the uncertainties quoted are statistical and systematic 
respectively taking correlations into account 
while the technique described above is based on different assumptions 
than the tl method of section we note that in their implementation the two techniques 
are quite similar both techniques use events in reliso sideband combined with scale 
factor determined from an independent control sample to estimate the background in the 
signal region the most notable differences are the requirement of the 
which targets leptons from decay in the method the choice of variables 


used to parametrize in one case and iso or iso in the other and the size of the 
reliso sideband used in the extrapolation 
combining the background estimates for events with one and two fake leptons and 
propagating all statistical and systematic uncertainties between channels including their 
correlations we arrive at final estimate of background due to fake leptons of 
events with the first second uncertainty being statistical systematic

the largest source of systematic uncertainties in the prediction of background events 
is due to lack of statistics of simulated events to validate the method in addition 
we find uncertainties of and in and respectively due to the 
correlation of with ht we measure for ht gev we determine the 
systematic uncertainty as the difference in the number of predicted background events from 
the reference measurement at ht gev with the measurement for ht gev 
from simulation studies it is found that an additional systematic uncertainty must 
be added in quadrature in the and channels to account for neglecting background 
contributions from fake electrons and muons taking all of this into account we arrive 
at an estimate of events with fake leptons where the uncertainties are 
statistical and systematic respectively 


comparison of leptonic and ht analyses with electrons and 
muons in the final state 

as discussed above we utilize two different trigger strategies to define selections that cover 
the maximum phase space possible in our search for new physics in addition the fact 
that these two selections have an overlap allows us to perform direct comparisons and 
that we present in this section 
we start by defining an overlap preselection requiring one electron or muon of 
pt gev and second with pt gev ht gev and no etmiss or isolation 
requirements we note that this corresponds to the preselection sample from section 
with the pt of the leptons tightened to be consistent with section comparing yields 
from this selection for the two trigger strategies on an basis we find that 
all of the ht events are also present in the sample from this 
comparison we calculate efficiencies for the ht and leptonic triggers to be and 

respectively while statistics are limited this confirms the trigger efficiencies 
measured in independent data samples as presented in section 
sections and introduced two alternative methods for estimating the background 
due to fake leptons here we compare the two independent predictions in the region of 
overlap for the two searches to compare the two methods in common signal region we 





table validation of the tl method the number of observed events is compared to the number 
of predicted events in simulation first two columns and in control region 
with relaxed selection criteria last two columns the simulation is normalized to the first 
and second uncertainties in the number of predicted events in data are statistical and systematic 
respectively 

require etmiss gev and the lepton isolation described in section in addition to the 
preselection defined above the tl method predicts based on yield of events 
that pass the loose selection the second method introduced in section results in an 
estimate of events based on events in the reliso sideband both of these 
uncertainties are statistical only we thus conclude that the two trigger strategies lead to 
consistent results within the kinematic region where they overlap and the two methods of 
estimating backgrounds due to fake leptons give consistent results in that region 


electron charge mismeasurement 

second potentially important source of background consists of dilepton 
events or where the sign of the charge of one of the electrons is mismeasured 
because of hard bremsstrahlung in the tracker volume 
we measure the electron charge in three different ways two of the measurements 
are based on the reconstructed track from two separate tracking algorithms the standard 
cms track reconstruction algorithm and the gaussian sum filter algorithm 
optimized for the measurement of electron tracks that radiate in the tracker material 
the third measurement is based on the relative position of the calorimeter cluster and 
the projection to the calorimeter of line segment built out of hits in the pixel detector 
to reduce the effect of charge mismeasurements we require agreement among the three 
measurements 
after this requirement the probability of mismeasuring the charge of an electron in 
simulation is at the level of few per mille even in the region where the amount 
of material is largest as can be seen in figure left 
to demonstrate our understanding of this probability we show in figure right the 
spectrum for ee events and our prediction from 
ee with one mismeasured charge the sample shown uses the tight electron selection 
described in section except with no jet or ht requirement instead we require etmiss 





figure left the probability to mismeasure the electron charge as function of in the pt 
range gev as obtained from simulation right ee invariant mass distribution 
in data compared with the ee expectation from simulation 



signal acceptance and efficiency systematic uncertainties 

electron and muon identification efficiencies above pt gev are known at the level 
of per electron and per muon based on studies of large samples of ee and 
events in data and simulation the uncertainties increase as the efficiencies themselves 
decrease towards lower pt reaching per muon electron at gev in addition there is potential mismodelling of the lepton isolation efficiency between data and 
simulation that grows with the amount of hadronic activity per event to assess this we 
compare the isolation efficiency as function of track multiplicity in data and simulation 
for ee and and extrapolate to new physics signals with large hadronic activity 
using simulation as discussed in more detail in section based on this we assign an 
additional systematic uncertainty per lepton there is also uncertainty 
associated with the lepton ht trigger efficiency 
the efficiency of the hadronic selection is studied in data via the process 
where one decays hadronically while the other decays into muon the available 
statistics are an order of magnitude lower than the statistics available in ee or at 
significantly lower purity accordingly reconstruction versus pt can not be studied at 
the same level of detail in data as for the electron and muon reconstruction and we depend 





gev and transverse mass gev to reduce backgrounds from jets the highestpt lepton has been used in the calculation of the transverse mass 
measurement of the electron momentum is dominated by the energy measurements in 
the calorimeter while the measurement of its charge is dominated by measurements in the 
tracker an electron with mismeasured charge will thus still have correctly measured 
momentum leading to the clear peak in the displayed in figure 
right normalized to the simulation predicts events in the mass 
region with the quoted uncertainty due to statistics in data we observe events in 
the same region we predict the yield in simulation and data 
based on reweighting the yield by 
parametrization of the probability for electron charge mismeasurement as function of pt 
and 
for the leptonic trigger searches we estimate the number of background events due 
to charge misidentification by scaling the yields by the above probability 
function we estimate the background due to electron charge misidentification as 
and for the etmiss gev and ht gev regions respectively 
for the ht searches these backgrounds are further reduced since the 
yield is smaller given the tighter ht requirement the resulting background 
prediction is ee and events for the search with in 
the final state this background is negligible and ignored as even in the 
channel background contributions dominate over those with prompt 
we assign systematic uncertainty on the estimated backgrounds due to electron 
charge mismeasurement this is motivated by the statistics available in the doubly charged 
signal region 



summary of results 

the results of our searches are summarized in table the background bg predictions 
are given by the rows labelled in addition to the background estimate from 
data we also present an estimate of the background based on simulation in the rows labeled 
as while qcd multijet production samples are used for testing background estimation methods in our control regions they are too statistically limited to provide meaningful 
estimates of yields in the signal regions listed in table and are thus not included all 
other sm simulation samples described in section are included figure summarizes 
the signal region yields and background composition in all four search regions presented in 
table the lepton plus jets background where the second lepton candidate is fake lepton 
from jet clearly dominates all search regions the analysis has small but 
background contribution from events with two fake leptons estimates for 
backgrounds due to events with one or two fake leptons were obtained directly from data 
in appropriately chosen control regions as described in detail in sections and 
in the ee and final states small additional background constributions are present due to 
the electron charge mismeasurement as discussed in section the remaining irreducible 
background from two prompt isolated leptons wz zz ttw etc amounts to 
at most of the total and is estimated based on theoretical cross section predictions and 
simulation uncertainties on the background prediction include statistical and systematic 
uncertainties added in quadrature contributions estimated with simulation are assigned 





to greater extent on an accurate simulation than we do for electrons and muons we 
assign an uncertainty of to the selection efficiency to account for the limited 
statistics available in data to validate the efficiency measured in simulation 
an additional source of systematic uncertainty is associated with the current 
uncertainty on the hadronic energy scale at cms this scale uncertainty limits our 
understanding of the efficiency of the ht and etmiss requirements clearly final states where 
the typical ht and etmiss are large compared to the selection values used in the analysis are 
less affected than those with smaller ht and etmiss we compute the systematic uncertainty 
due to this effect for the benchmark point with the four signal selections using the 
method of ref we use the model as it is typical of the possible susy final states 
to which these analyses are sensitive we find that the uncertainty varies between at 
ht gev and at ht gev the values of ht used in the selections for the 
baseline and search respectively 
uncertainties in the acceptance due to the modelling of and radiation 
and knowledge of the parton density functions pdf are estimated to be for the 
latter we use the pdf and their uncertainties 
based on as signal model we arrive at total uncertainties on signal efficiencies 
of and for the lepton triggered ht triggered low pt and ht triggered 
analyses respectively this includes luminosity systematic uncertainty in 
addition to interpret these limits in terms of constraints on new physics models one needs 
to take into account any theoretical uncertainties

studies the ht variable can be approximated by defining it as the scalar sum of the

by the jet energy scale uncertainty the resolution on these two quantities differs for the

introduction 








































the cms detector 

the compact muon solenoid cms is nearly hermetic multipurpose detector and is 
described in detail elsewhere charged particle trajectories are measured with silicon 
pixel and strip tracking detectors encompassed by superconducting solenoid with 
full azimuthal coverage and the azimuthal angle is defined in the plane 
transverse to the beam direction the pseudorapidity is defined as 
where is the polar angle with respect to the counterclockwise proton beam direction 
with the origin at the center of the detector energy deposits of particles are measured 
with crystal electromagnetic ecal and or 
hadronic hcal calorimeters muon candidates are 
identified in detectors embedded in the steel return yoke of the magnet 



candidate event selection 

we use the data sample collected by the cms detector at the lhc from march to november 
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of events are required to have 
at least one high transverse momentum pt electron or muon in addition to photon 
events are selected and recorded using trigger system we use suite of singleelectron and triggers with several thresholds changing to match the rapidly 
increasing instantaneous luminosity of the lhc the electron candidates are reconstructed 
from clusters of energy in the ecal barrel and endcaps and 
are required to match charged tracks reconstructed in the silicon tracking detectors muons 
are reconstructed as charged tracks matched to hit patterns in the muon detectors we 
further require the leading electron or muon to have pt gev and to satisfy 
set of identification and isolation criteria for electrons the region from 
is excluded since it contains services and cables exiting between the transition 
of the barrel and endcap calorimeters and leads to lower quality reconstructed clusters

background estimation 

the dominant background process is production with the boson decaying leptonically this background is estimated using the madgraph mc generator with parton 
showering using pythia the result is scaled from the lo to the nlo cross section obtained from the wgrad nlo generator 
and using the nlo parton distribution function pdf sets for example for 
photon with pt gev the factor is the nlo calculation is in good 
agreement with the production cross section measured by the cms collaboration 
over the relevant phase space of that measurement giving confidence in the nlo prediction 
used here the mc events are processed with the full cms detector simulation based on 
the package to estimate the uncertainty on the factor due to 
corrections we vary the factorisation and renormalisation scales by factor of two and 
observe variation in the cross section of approximately additional systematic uncertainties on this background estimate include the uncertainties on the trigger efficiencies 
and scale factors described above the pdf set estimated using the 
working group procedure and the integrated luminosity measurement 
the next most important instrumental background originates from sm processes that 
have misidentified leptons and photons methods are used to determine all 
backgrounds involving object misidentification we consider sources of background in 
which jet or an electron is misidentified as photon jet and or in which 
jet is misidentified as lepton the dominant sm processes that contribute to the jet 





events in which the electron is consistent with having originated from photon conversion 
are rejected the efficiency of the triggers for events with an electron muon with pt 
above gev is measured to be lepton identification and 
reconstruction efficiencies are measured in data using decays the ratio of the 
lepton efficiencies measured in data to those from monte carlo mc simulation described 
below is found to be for an electron muon we require the 
presence of at least one photon with pt gev spatially separated from the 
lepton by the reconstruction of photon candidates 
in the calorimeter is similar to that of the electrons with the additional requirement that 
they do not have associated hit patterns in the pixel detector consistent with track 
the scale factor for the photon efficiency is we demand that the 
lepton and the photon candidates be isolated from any other activity in the tracker ecal 
or hcal the events are required to contain at least one reconstructed primary vertex 
within cm of the geometric center of the detector along the beamline and transverse 
distance with respect to the reconstructed beam axis of less than cm these selections 
define our candidate sample which consists of events in the channel 
finally in order to minimise the number of expected background events while retaining

for the expected calorimeter response for each reconstructed hadron track

we performed several to support our modeling of the sm backgrounds 
for example events with mt above gev have small qcd background as shown in 
figure bottom and we verified that we can describe all the kinematic distributions in 
these events with the sum of the expected backgrounds except the contribution from qcd 
we also checked that the photon candidates have timing consistent with having originated 
from the primary vertex to verify that backgrounds are negligible finally 
we verified that our qcd background determination procedure works in the presence of 





misidentification background include and qcd multijet production the jet 
background is determined by selecting sample of events that satisfy the criteria of 
our candidate sample except that the photon is required to fail either the isolation or 
electromagnetic shower shape criterion we then weight this sample by the probability of 
misidentifying jet as photon to estimate the total contribution of this background 
to the signal sample the sm processes contributing to the misidentification background are predominantly and production the background is determined in 
similar way to the jet background by selecting sample of events that satisfy the 
criteria of our candidate sample but with the additional requirement that the photon be 
matched to pattern of hits in the pixel tracker we then weight this sample by the probability of misidentifying an electron as photon to estimate the total contribution of 
this background to the signal sample the probability is determined from

conclusions 


we performed the first search in collisions at tev for an excess of 
miss over the sm expectation using data 
events with photon lepton and large et 
sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of collected with the cms 
detector at the lhc we find no evidence of such an excess our results are interpreted as 
cl lower limits on ggm susy particle masses in benchmark model additionally 
the cl upper limits on the cross sections of generic susy production as function of 
squark gluino and wino masses are also provided allowing other susy scenarios to be 
constrained these limits are the most stringent to date for large range of parameters in 
this ggm susy scenario 





we use bayesian approach to determine the cl upper limits on the cross 
sections in the benchmark susy model described above combining the likelihoods of 
the and channels the inputs for both channels are the sum of the 
backgrounds the background as determined from the mc simulation and corrected 
by the appropriate scale factors and for each mc susy point the efficiency 
times acceptance corrected for the appropriate scale factors each of these 
inputs for given channel has distributed nuisance parameters that vary by 
the uncertainty in each quantity we consider the uncertainty on the luminosity as 
an additional nuisance parameter as an example of the calculation the efficiency times 
acceptance times branching ratio for the gmc benchmark point for is 
the cl upper limit on the cross section obtained for this 
point is pb the limit is less than the predicted nlo cross section for this point 
pb with uncertainties due to the pdf and the renormalization scale 
we therefore exclude this point with more than confidence the observed cl 
upper limits on the cross section are shown in figure as function of the squark gluino 
and the wino masses for the kinematic selections applied in this analysis an electron with 
pt gev or muon with pt gev and 
miss gev figure displays the 
photon with pt gev events with et 
resulting cl exclusion region in the squark gluino and wino mass plane where masses

introduction 

supersymmetry susy is an extension of the standard model sm of particle 
physics which can solve the and provide candidate for cold 
dark matter for large class of supersymmetric parameter sets squarks 
the susy 
partners of quarks are relatively light in this case significant event yields at the large 
hadron collider lhc can result from strong production of squarks which subsequently 
decay giving weakly interacting lightest supersymmetric particle lsp if bottom and 
top squarks which can decay to quarks are relatively light there may be an abundance 
of events with one or more jets and momentum imbalance transverse to the beam 
line due to the undetectable lsps 
this letter describes search for events with two or more hadronic jets at least 
one of which must be tagged and significant transverse momentum imbalance it 
extends similar search without requirement the momentum imbalance 
is characterized by the ratio of the pt of the jet and the invariant 
ht 

mass formed from the two jets this ratio can be estimated by

is the momentum transverse to the beam 
line for jet in an event the jets in an event are grouped into two and is 
the minimal value of 

over all combinations this approach optimizes 


rejection of backgrounds with apparent 
from instrumental effects and other sources 
the main backgrounds are due to standard model multijet production hereafter denoted electroweak and boson production ewk and top quark 





introduction 



event selection 

the event selection requirements are mostly identical to those in ref events in the 
search sample are collected with triggers based on ht computed from jets reconstructed at 
trigger level control sample is collected with triggers requiring muon 
events must have good reconstructed pp collision vertex jets are reconstructed 
as clusters of energy in the calorimeters by the algorithm with distance 
parameter of and are required to have energy transverse to the beam et in excess of 
gev and less than 
to perform fully hadronic final state search and to reduce the backgrounds events 
with an isolated lepton electron or muon or photon are vetoed and events consistent 
with having apparent 
are rejected selected events are required to have at least 
two jets both with et gev for the jet ht gev at 
least one jet tagged as originating from quark and 
jets are tagged using discriminator based on the impact parameter significance 
of tracks in jet track counting high purity discriminator tchp with 
selection tchp designed to have contamination of less than 





pair production tt owing to low average 
the qcd background is effectively rejected 
by requirement on the requirement further suppresses the qcd and ewk 
backgrounds 
the results of the search are characterized in terms of the 
scenario of susy these models are described by four parameters and one sign the universal scalar and gaugino mass parameters and respectively the universal trilinear 
coupling the ratio of the two higgs doublet vacuum expectation values tan and the 
sign of the higgs mixing parameter three signal points are considered as benchmarks both discussed in ref and lmb corresponding to gev 
gev gev tan and chosen to be near the edge of 
sensitivity of this search in parameter space 
the choice of tan for the lmb point is appropriate because of its 
enrichment however this choice of parameter space is merely benchmark light bottom 
and top squarks are in fact generic feature of many supersymmetiric models this analysis 
extends the sensitivity beyond ref for such enriched models because of the 
reduced backgrounds 
the analysis presented here uses data sample of collisions at tev 
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of collected with the compact muon 
solenoid cms detector at the lhc the main components of cms are silicon pixel 
and strip tracker the crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and the hadron 
calorimeter all placed in axial magnetic field complemented by detectors embedded in the steel return yoke to measure muons detailed description 
of the detector and its performance can be found in ref in the cylindrical coordinate system of cms is the azimuthal angle and the is defined 
as ln tan where is the polar angle with respect to the counterclockwise 
beam direction 

looser selections are used to produce various control samples an event is said 
to be if it contains no jets with loose tag tchp to remain within 
the acceptance of the pixel tracker only jets with central axis of are considered 
for tagging 



background estimation 



background prediction using vs ht extrapolation 

in sm simulation studies has no ht dependence in events with large 
genuine missing transverse energy the tt and ewk backgrounds in the qcd background however is expected to be decreasing function of ht because of the 
ht dependence of the factors contributing to apparent 
such as jet energy resolution 
and jet et threshold effects 
in data control samples is consistent with having no ht dependence 
which indicates that the tt and ewk backgrounds dominate the larger data 
sample is also consistent with having no ht dependence because tight requirement 
further suppresses the qcd background the tight tagged data sample is expected to have 
negligible qcd contribution and therefore independent of ht 
in 
the total background is estimated by measuring 

control region with ht gev and multiplying this fraction by the number 
of events in the signal region before the requirement in data this procedure 
yields prediction of 
stat syst events the statistical uncertainty is 
dominated by the presence of one event with in the control sample the systematic uncertainty on the prediction is given by the difference in measured 
in the tight and loose tagged control samples table lists this background prediction the 
observation in data and the expected contribution of susy signal for points 
and lmb 





the backgrounds for this search can be categorized into three main groups namely qcd 
ewk and tt the contamination from tt is mainly in the tau decay mode the vast 
majority of events from the qcd background do not feature large transverse momentum 
imbalance and are therefore rejected by the requirement the ewk backgrounds 
consist of and boson production with genuine missing energy due to decay neutrinos 
the requirement of at least one jet greatly reduces the ewk and qcd backgrounds 
the dominant background for the analysis arises from tt production in which jets and 
genuine missing energy due to neutrinos can arise from the top quark decay chains 
procedure based on control data samples described in section is employed to 
estimate all backgrounds simultaneously in this method the fraction of all events with 
denoted is measured in control region and applied 
in the signal region 
the and tt background yields are separately as discussed in 
section the tt uses muons to emulate the hadronic decays of taus the 
of utilizes events for which is determined after excluding 
the muons

while the above background estimate is the one used in this search we perform auxiliary

of an observed excess these provide an overestimate of the and tt

ht or requirements the solid blue line in figure shows the distribution

then sample is selected with no requirement jet et gev thresholds on 
the two jets ht gev and the number of events in this 
sample is scaled by the measured fraction in the other sample corrected for the muon 
identification efficiency and acceptance and multiplied by the ratio of branching fractions 

this procedure gives an overestimate of the number of events 

in the signal region owing to less stringent requirements than in the final selection and 
yields events 
simulation studies indicate that most of the tt background comes from events with 
hadronic tau decays to estimate the hadronic tau decay yield is first

for jets passing and failing the analysis requirement are used in the 
efficiency calculation this efficiency is measured separately for jets with and 
in four ranges of jet et the ratio between the efficiency measured in data

introduction 

several theories beyond the standard model sm of particle physics address the gauge 
hierarchy problem and other shortcomings of the sm by introducing spectrum of new 
particles that are partners of the sm particles these new particles may include 
neutral stable and weakly interacting particles that are good candidates the 
identity and properties of the fundamental that make up dark matter are two 
of the most important unsolved problems in particle physics and cosmology the energy 
density of dark matter is approximately five times larger than for the normal baryonic 
matter that corresponds to the luminous portion of the universe review on dark matter 
can be found in ref 





introduction 





many candidates are stable as result of conserved quantity in supersymmetry susy this quantity is parity and its conservation requires all susy particles 
to be produced in pairs and the lightest susy particle lsp to be stable coloured susy 
particles can be copiously at the large hadron collider lhc these particles will decay directly into sm particles and an lsp or via intermediate 
states that ultimately decay into an lsp resulting in large amount of energy deposited in 
the detector the lsp will pass through the detector without interacting carrying away 
substantial amount of energy and creating an imbalance in the measured transverse 
momentum pt 
experiments at the tevatron sps lep and hera colliders 
have performed extensive searches for susy and set lower limits on the masses of susy 
particles at the lhc the cms collaboration has previously published limits in the allhadronic channel based on search using the kinematic variable the atlas 
collaboration has also published limits from missing transverse momentum and multijet 
search 
in this paper results are presented from search for large missing transverse momentum in multijet events produced in pp collisions at of tev using 
data sample collected with the cms detector at the lhc in corresponding to an integrated luminosity of the results of the search are presented in the context of the 
constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model cmssm 
and in the more general context of simplified models these latter models are 
designed to characterize experimental data in terms of small number of particles whose 
masses and decay branching fractions are allowed to vary freely the results are independent of any more complete theory that addresses the deeper problems of particle physics 
yet they can be translated into any such desired framework 
this search is complementary to the cms analysis that used the kinematic variable 
as the search variable in events with at least two jets that variable is very effective 
in suppressing the qcd multijet background but with some loss of signal acceptance in 
contrast this search only selects events with jets and the missing and visible transverse 
momentum sums are used as search variables for an inclusive selection with higher signal 
acceptance 
the main backgrounds in this analysis are an irreducible background from 
events with the boson decaying to denoted as and events 
with either the boson or one of the bosons from the decays going directly or via to an or that is lost or going to that decays hadronically 
in all these cases one or more neutrinos provide genuine source of missing transverse 
momentum and qcd multijet events with large missing transverse momentum from 
leptonic decays of hadrons inside the jets jet energy mismeasurement or 
instrumental noise and detector components the relative contributions 
of these three categories of backgrounds depend on the event selection 
this paper is organized as follows the cms detector and event reconstruction are 
described in section in section the event selection criteria are presented the backgrounds to this search are directly determined from the data in some cases with novel 



the cms detector and event reconstruction 

the central feature of the cms apparatus is superconducting solenoid in length 
and in diameter which provides an axial magnetic field of the bore of the 
solenoid is instrumented with various particle detection systems the steel return yoke 
outside the solenoid is in turn instrumented with gas detectors which are used to identify 
muons charged particle trajectories are measured by the silicon pixel and strip tracker 
covering in azimuth and where the pseudorapidity is defined as 
ln with being the polar angle of the momentum with respect 
to the counterclockwise beam direction crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ecal and hadronic calorimeter hcal surround the tracking 
volume and cover the region forward hadron calorimeters extend 
the coverage to the detector is nearly hermetic allowing for momentum balance 
measurements in the plane transverse to the beam directions detailed description of the 
cms detector can be found elsewhere 
all physics objects are reconstructed with technique this algorithm identifies and reconstructs individually the particles produced in the collision namely 
charged and neutral hadrons photons muons and electrons by combining the information 
from the tracking system the calorimeters and the muon system all these particles are 
clustered into jets using the algorithm with distance parameter of from 
fastjet jet energies are corrected for the calorimeter response using 
calibration factors derived from simulation and for jets in data an additional residual 
energy correction derived from data is applied as the average number of additional 
pileup interactions during the lhc data taking is roughly between two and three no 
subtraction of the pileup energy deposits is performed 



sample selection 

the event selection for this search aims to be inclusive such that it can detect new physics 
from any model yielding hadronic final state with missing transverse 
momentum therefore the observables of central interest in the search are chosen to 





techniques which are being applied here for the first time in section the irreducible 
background is estimated from events and alternative and control 
samples are studied the background from and where lepton is either lost 
or is hadronically decaying tau lepton is estimated from events by ignoring or 
replacing the muon as discussed in section the qcd multijet kinematics are predicted 
using measured jet resolution functions to smear events obtained by procedure that produces events out of inclusive multijet data as discussed in section as 
the correlation between the transverse missing momentum vector and the 
angular distance between that vector and the closest leading jet is used to predict the tail 
of the distribution in section the interpretation of the observed 
data is presented 

be the magnitude of the missing transverse momentum 
calculated from jets and the 
scalar sum of the jet transverse momenta ht the choice of these observables and the 
applied background suppression cuts aim for minimal kinematic bias in the search for 
new physics signals this facilitates the characterization of new physics in the case of 
discovery furthermore the selection is chosen to be efficient for models containing new 
particles with sufficiently small mass and thus sizeable production yield for the integrated 
luminosity used in this search in this section the event selection is described based on 
the above considerations 
trigger selection and cleaning of the data sample 

the data used in this analysis were collected with triggers based on the quantity httrig defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of reconstructed calorimeter jets without 
response corrections having pt gev and the httrig threshold varied between 
and gev as the instantaneous luminosity of the lhc increased the ht trigger 
has high acceptance for hadronic signatures and it enables the 
simultaneous collection of several control samples used to estimate the backgrounds the 
trigger efficiency as function of the ht defined below in section 
was measured using data taken with trigger it was found to be 
close to for ht values above gev 
ways to remove events with poor 
measurement were investigated using both simulation and data various sources of noise in the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters 
are rejected background events and displaced satellite collisions are 
removed by requiring primary vertex within the luminous region applying veto asking for significant fraction of tracks in the event to be 
of high quality and requiring the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of tracks associated with the primary vertex to be greater than of the scalar sum of the transverse 
momenta of all jets within the tracker acceptance events are also rejected in which 
significant amount of energy is determined to have been lost in the approximately of 
crystals in the ecal that are masked in reconstruction such losses 
are identified either by exploiting the energy measured through parallel readout path 
used for the online trigger or by measuring the energy deposited around masked crystals 
when information from this parallel readout path is not available the small inefficiency 
for signal events induced by this cleaning is discussed further in section 


baseline and search event selections 

the search selection starts from loosely selected sample of candidate events from this 
baseline sample tighter search selection criteria are then applied to obtain the 
final event sample the baseline selection requirements are 
at least three jets with pt gev and 
ht gev with ht defined as the scalar sum of the transverse momenta of all 
jets with pt gev and 








gev with 
defined as the magnitude of the negative vector sum of the 
transverse momenta of all jets with pt gev and this requirement 
suppresses the vast majority of the qcd multijet events 

and 
where is the azimuthal 
angular difference between the jet axis jn and the 
direction for the three highestpt jets in the event this requirement rejects most of the qcd multijet events in 
which single mismeasured jet yields

two search regions are chosen based on the observables central to this inclusive search the first selection defining the 
search 
region tightens the baseline cuts with 
gev requirement motivated by the 
search for generic candidate which gives large background rejection the 
second selection adds cut of ht gev to the baseline criteria yielding the 
search region which is sensitive to the higher multiplicities from cascade decays of highmass particles such cascades lead to more energy being transferred to visible 
particles and less to invisible ones

background estimation 

the production of boson and jets followed by the decay of the boson into neutrinos 
constitutes an irreducible background the first method to estimate this background from 
the data exploits the electroweak correspondence between the boson and the photon at 
high pt where they exhibit similar characteristics apart from electroweak coupling differences and asymptotically vanishing residual mass effects the ratio 
between the and photon production provides robust prediction of the missing 
transverse momentum spectrum for invisible bosons at high pt where the photon production cross section is asymptotically about less than the one for inclusive 
production one important distinction between photon and production arises 
from the breakdown of the calculation of the process for 
or emission of the photon in the absence of mass to regularize the resulting divergences this can be mitigated by imposing isolation requirements on the selected 
photon sample

photon candidates are distinguished from electrons by veto on the presence of track

them to be isolated and the shower shape in the coordinate to be consistent with that of 
single photon 
for the derivation of the correction factor simulated and 
madgraph samples are used in addition to the qcd multijet and 
samples the contribution of fragmentation photons which do not have counterpart 
in the massive production is estimated from nlo jetphox calculations to 
be in the selected photon sample second background arises from isolated 
neutral pions and mesons decaying to pairs of secondary photons for 
mesons these photon pairs are sufficiently well collimated to be reconstructed as single 
photon using method that fits photon isolation observable to the expected distributions 
for real and background photons the purity of the prompt photon sample is found to be 

after the baseline selection which is in good agreement with simulation finally 
the background from electrons as photons is measured with data 
events and is found to be negligible for the search selections

table overview of all correction factors and corresponding systematic uncertainties for the

is taken as while the theoretical uncertainty is estimated from comparison of 
leading to calculations of the ratio of and production with two 
jets this dedicated calculation was performed for the different selections in this analysis adapted to only two jets the addition of an extra jet is mostly insensitive to the 
nature of the boson and is not expected to induce significant effect on the 
ratio this leads to theoretical uncertainty on the ratio for the 
baseline selection which is taken as uniformly distributed systematic uncertainty with 
standard deviation of the photon reconstruction inefficiency is estimated in ref 
to be finally the photon identification and isolation efficiency is corrected 
for the difference between data and simulation the correction is determined to be

in table the full list of corrections is summarized for the baseline and search selections 
along with the corresponding systematic uncertainties the results for the 
prediction from the control sample are summarized in table the prediction is in 
good agreement with the one found directly from the mc simulation also given in table 
potential alternative method to estimate the background in conceptually more straightforward way uses jets data events by counting the pair of 
leptons as missing transverse momentum the topology of the process can be reproduced and all selection criteria can be directly applied only small number 
of jets events pass the selection criteria in the currently available data after the 
baseline selection applying selection requirements and correcting for the acceptance efficiencies and different branching fractions the predicted rates are found 
to be compatible with the simulation predictions within uncertainties however none of 
the and events pass either of the search selections

more events can be used for predicting the background by using

and 
background estimation 

the muon and electron vetoes described in section aim to suppress sm events with an 
isolated lepton the and events however are not rejected by this lepton veto 
when lepton from or decay is outside the geometric or kinematic acceptances not reconstructed not isolated these three cases are denoted as 
or is tau lepton that decays hadronically denoted as in this section two methods 
are presented to estimate these two components of the and backgrounds from 
data the first method uses control sample after correcting for lepton inefficiencies to estimate the number of events that fail the isolated lepton reconstruction the 
other method predicts the hadronic background from similar control sample 
by substituting jet for the muon for both methods the chosen control sample 
fully represents the hadronic and other properties of the background it predicts 
the sum of the and predictions yields an estimate for the sum 
of the and background the contribution is also measured separately as 
the method predicts the background from control sample 
by correcting for the efficiency acceptance and the residual and multijet 
contamination using the ratio predicted by simulation the result is found to be 
consistent with the estimates described in the subsequent sections

the lepton isolation efficiency is measured from events using method as function of lepton pt and the angular distance between the lepton 
and the nearest jet the lepton identification efficiency is parametrized as function of 
lepton pt and using these parametrizations the efficiencies measured in events can 
be applied to the kinematically different and events 
leptons can be out of the acceptance because either their transverse momentum is too 
small or they are emitted in the forward direction electrons and muons from decays in 
particular tend to have low momentum while the additional neutrinos add to the 
of 
the event the ratio raccept of events with leptons to those within the 
acceptance is estimated using simulation the same muon control sample described above 
is used weighted by raccept and corrected for the isolation and identification efficiencies 
to estimate the background from leptons 
the dominant uncertainties on the prediction arise from the statistical uncertainties of both the control sample and the sample from which the lepton efficiencies 
are measured using simulation studies systematic uncertainty is assigned to the kinematic differences that remain after the parametrization in the pt and 
spectra of the signal and control regions of the and samples the residual presence 
of qcd or diboson events in the control sample is taken into account as systematic

the 
background estimation 

hadronically decaying tau leptons constitute an important second component of the 
and background in this section method is described to estimate the 
background from control sample mainly composed of and 
events this muon control sample is selected from data collected with triggers 
ensuring independence from the hadronic activity in the event events are required to have 
exactly one muon with pt gev and and to satisfy the identification and 
isolation requirements described in section 
jets from tau leptons are characterized by low multiplicity of particles typically 
few pions and neutrinos the hadronic properties of events in the background 
are identical to those of the muon control sample except for the fraction of the 
energy deposited in the calorimeters to account for this difference each muon in the 
control sample is replaced by object this object is built by scaling the muon 
momentum by factor obtained from simulated energy response distribution that models 
the fraction of visible momentum as function of the true lepton momentum 
the object is then added to the list of jets and taken into account when applying the 
selection cuts to obtain the background prediction from these modified events 
in order to probe the full response distribution this procedure is repeated multiple times 
for each event 
correction is applied for the kinematic and geometric acceptances of the muons in 
the control sample it is determined by applying muon smearing procedure to events 
in and simulated samples with muon from decay passing the muon kinematic 
selection and comparing the resulting yield to the one obtained using all muons from 
decay in the same events the resulting correction factor is for the baseline and 

selection and for the selection second correction takes into 
account the muon trigger reconstruction and isolation efficiencies the same procedure 
described in section is followed correction is also applied for the relative branching 
fractions of decays into muons or hadronic jets for the simulated events factor of 
is used in the generation of the events and as the correction factor while for data 
factor of is applied

the procedure for predicting the background was tested on simulated 
and events and reproduces the direct results from the simulation of genuine hadronic 
tau leptons from and decays within uncertainties for the baseline selection this 
uncertainty amounts to and for the and samples respectively the evaluation 
of the statistical uncertainty on the prediction needs special attention owing to the multiple 
sampling of the response distribution this uncertainty is evaluated with set of pseudoexperiments using the bootstrap technique 
the systematic uncertainties and their impact on the prediction are summarized in 
table the possible difference between data and simulation for the energy distribution 
is taken into account as systematic uncertainty estimated by scaling the visible energy 
fraction by resulting in variation in the 
prediction of possible sm 
background contamination in the muon control region comes from 
and from qcd multijet events the first two are subtracted using the 
mc simulation while the qcd multijet background is studied using an orthogonal control 
sample of events with muons the main source of background is 
estimated to be of the total control sample the number of events 
predicted in data using this method is summarized in table for the different signal regions 



qcd background estimation 

two methods are employed to estimate the qcd multijet contamination in this analysis 
the method estimates the multijet background directly from 
the data this method predicts the full kinematics in multijet events while being unaffected 
by events with true missing transverse momentum including the potential presence of 





table systematic uncertainties for the background prediction from the control 
sample for the baseline and search selections 

signal crucial inputs to this method are the jet energy resolutions which are measured 
from data including the tails the provides an 
alternative prediction for the qcd multijet background based on the extrapolation from 

control region to the 
search region using the correlation between 

and an angular variable 


the method 





large missing transverse momentum arises in qcd multijet events when one or more jets 
in the event have jet energy response far from unity where the jet energy response is 
the ratio of the transverse momentum of the reconstructed jet over the one which would 
result from measuring perfectly the of the particles in the jet 
the method is essentially simplified simulation where the jet energy response 
is modelled by parametrized resolution function which is used to smear sample of 
obtained from data and consisting of that are good estimators of the 
true momenta 
the seed events are produced in the step with an inclusive multijet data 
sample as input this sample is selected from events collected using the triggers described 
in section by requiring in addition two or more jets with pt gev using the 
resolution probability distribution these seed events are constructed by adjusting the jet 
true 
reco 
momenta in events with jets given the likelihood 
where and 
ptrue 
are the reconstructed and true jet transverse momentum respectively the likelihood 
is maximized as function of ptrue 
subject to the transverse momentum balance constraint 

true true here all clustered objects with gev are classified as 




true which is the true transverse momentum of the rest of the event can be 
jets and 
reco that comprises all particles not included in the jets 
approximated by the measured 
in other words the rebalancing step solves for the true momenta that bring the event 
into transverse momentum balance in way consistent with measurement uncertainties 
this forces events with genuine high 
from neutrinos or other undetected particles to be 
similar to events as such and events and also 
contributions from new physics if any have negligible impact on the background prediction 
since their production rate is much smaller than the qcd multijet production rate 
most of the events in the seed sample consist of jets with responses well within the 
core of the resolution distribution because of this the gaussian resolution model for 
is sufficient in the computation of the likelihood correction is needed though because jets near masked ecal cells have an energy response below unity and hence get 
systematically rebalanced to energies to mitigate the resulting bias each event is 
randomized in after rebalancing such that events dominate everywhere 
second correction to the rebalancing procedure is applied to account for the migration of 
reconstructed events towards higher ht due to residual resolution smearing effects this 
is achieved by inserting an additional term into the likelihood function with parameters 
tuned to make the predicted jet multiplicity distribution match the one observed in the 
inclusive data sample this correction induces less than change in the resulting 
distributions from data

next the momentum of each seed jet is smeared using the jet resolution distribution 
the search requirements can be applied to the resulting smeared events to predict all 
jet kinematic properties and correlations this allows for flexibility in the 
set of observables used to define the search region and in characterizing an observed 
signal the distributions predicted by the procedure are compared with those from 
and ht distributions are within of the 
mc simulation in figure the predicted

jet response distributions 

for smearing and therefore the prediction of the 
spectrum the full resolution functions 
including the tails are used the tails of the jet response function are of 
particular importance for the prediction of the qcd multijet background at high 

the jet momentum resolution functions are parametrized using simulated pythia dijet samples and adjusted to match the measurements from data as described below the 
response distributions are parametrized with respect to pt and furthermore an exceptionally low response arises at the specific locations where ecal channels have been 
masked this effect is taken into account by parametrizing the jet response as function 
ecal of jet momentum lost in the masked area of the detector computed 
of the fraction fmasked 
using template for the pt distribution of particles as function of the distance

figure left finally or quarks and also gluons exhibit different jet 
resolution shapes than light jets as shown in figure right at high jet pt decays of 
hadrons into neutrinos become one of the dominant sources of significant jet 
energy loss the jet resolution functions are determined for bottom charm gluon and 
other quarks separately the flavour dependence is then accounted for by 




















ing these resolution functions in the smearing procedure according to the flavour fractions 
from simulation 
two methods are used to measure from data scaling factor for the gaussian core of 
the jet momentum resolutions determined from simulation at low pt events 
are used because the photons are reconstructed with excellent energy resolution and the 
pt balance makes the photons good estimators of the true pt scale of the event at larger 
pt dijet events are used an unbinned maximum likelihood fit is performed on the dijet 



asymmetry

for both measurements the presence of additional jets in the event destroys the momentum 
balance and an extrapolation to activity is performed these methods 
measure the core of the gaussian resolution as function of jet to be larger in 
data compared to simulation with systematic uncertainties of similar size as the deviation 
no significant dependence on the pt of the jet is observed 
no significant tails are observed in events at higher pt the dijet 
asymmetry distributions show compatibility within uncertainties between the resolution 
tails from data and simulation using the ratio of these asymmetry distributions in data 
and simulation correction factors to the jet resolution tails from simulation are derived 
both scaling of the response below tail and above unity tail can 
induce the same change in the asymmetry distribution the latter arising for instance 
from mismeasured track momenta in jets therefore the nominal resolution 
functions are obtained by equally scaling both the lower and upper tails of the resolution in 
order to induce the observed scaling of the asymmetry tail the envelope of the variations 
induced by only or scaling is taken as the systematic uncertainty band for 
the jet resolution distribution

results of the method 

the performance of the procedure was validated using simulated pythia qcd multijet samples without pileup interactions where the parametrized response functions are 
derived from the same samples the predicted and expected number of events are summarized for several selections in table before the 
requirement the prediction of the 
ht spectrum the jet kinematics and the angular and pt correlation distributions 
agree within with the direct simulation the 
distribution shows bias up to 
which is mostly due to dependency of the jet resolution on the presence of nearby jets 
this is only of importance in the region of very high 
however where the qcd multijet 
contribution is negligible compared to other backgrounds 
the qcd multijet background is predicted using the inclusive data sample with events 
passing the same ht triggers described in section the steps are then executed 
using the jet energy resolution functions and the core and tail scale factors described in section the background predictions are obtained by applying the event selection requirements to the events the rejection efficiency of events with large energy loss in masked 
ecal channels is modelled using parametrized probability from simulation 
in table the number of predicted events is listed for the baseline and search regions 
along with the relevant systematic uncertainties corrections are applied to the background 
estimates for several known biases in the method as summarized in table the largest 
one pertains to the smearing step and arises from ambiguities in how the jet resolution 
is defined and from limitations in the parametrization it is obtained in simulation by 
comparing the prediction from smeared particle jets with the corresponding one from the 
detector simulation the size of the difference is taken as both bias correction and 
systematic uncertainty 
second bias is intrinsic to the rebalancing procedure and is studied by iterating the 
method first iteration of the method gives sample of pure qcd multijet 
events with known true jet resolution by construction the one used in the smearing 
step performing second iteration of the method on this sample using 
the same resolutions provides closure test of just the rebalancing part when compared to 
the input events the degree of the excess of over 
predicted events is measured to be which is also assigned as systematic uncertainty

table number of qcd multijet events predicted with the method before and after bias 
corrections along with all considered uncertainties and the type of uncertainty uniform 
symmetric or asymmetric gaussian distribution effects in italics are the biases corrected for as 
described in the text with the full size of the bias taken as the systematic uncertainty 

the same procedure is employed to study the bias caused by using 
reco as an estimator of true the true value of true in the second iteration is equal 



to the 
value calculated from the rebalanced jets in the first iteration the difference 
reco and true as input is used as third bias 
between the predictions with 

correction with corresponding systematic uncertainty 
the largest systematic effect arises from uncertainties on the jet momentum resolution 
the measurement uncertainties on the core resolutions and tails discussed 
in section are propagated by repeating the prediction with resolution inputs 
varied within these uncertainties another systematic uncertainty comes from the flavourdependent parametrization of the jet resolutions it is evaluated as the difference between 
the use of pythia and madgraph simulated samples to derive the and content 
parametrization these mc generators have fractions that differ by roughly 
for bottom and for charm quarks nevertheless the difference in the resulting 
background prediction is very small in the search regions and the qcd multijet 
contribution is negligible in the 
search region 
the effect of pileup is studied by performing the prediction with subset of 
events with exactly one reconstructed primary vertex the relative difference between 
this prediction and the one obtained from the inclusive sample is taken as systematic 
uncertainty

the factorization method 

because of the importance of estimating the qcd multijet background an independent 
approach is used as the factorization method uses the observables 
and 
of which the latter is the minimum azimuthal angle between the 
direction and 
the three leading jets to predict the number of events in the signal region of high 
and 
large from the sideband regions where one or both variables are small as 
and 
are not independent observables their correlation is measured in the 
region 
by means of the ratio 
of the number of events with large to the number with 
small the number of background events is estimated from the extrapolation of 
to the 
signal region 
the parametrization of 
is chosen empirically with two different ones being used 
the first parametrization the gaussian model predicts gaussian distribution for 
assuming all jets except the most mismeasured jet to have an energy response following 
gaussian resolution function the width of this distribution as function of 
is described 





other smaller uncertainties arise from the event selection potential loss of events 
due to the ht trigger requirement on the events that enter the rebalancing is quantified 
by comparing the prediction made with the small number of events collected with 
trigger conservative upper bound of on this uncertainty is taken another 
uncertainty arises from the need to predict the number of smeared events that pass the 
search trigger the ht triggers used were measured on data to be fully efficient with respect 
to events passing the offline cuts and the statistical upper bound from this measurement 
is taken as systematic uncertainty for the selections finally the lepton veto 
has an uncertainty that is estimated as the full size of the rejection rate for qcd multijet 
events in pythia event sample with pileup conditions representative of the data the 
large size of this uncertainty for the baseline search region is due to statistical 
uncertainty induced by mc sample with very small equivalent luminosity 
variations within one standard deviation or within upper and lower bounds are performed for each systematic effect and the corresponding differences in the predictions are 
quoted in table estimated shapes of the probability distribution of each uncertainty 
are also listed uncertainties that are estimated as upper bounds on possible effects are assumed to have uniform distribution the statistical uncertainty is associated 
with the size of the seed event sample as prescribed by the bootstrap method an 
ensemble of is selected randomly from the original seed sample allowing 
repetition the ensemble spread of predictions made from these is taken 
as the statistical uncertainty 
after correcting for biases the prediction and systematic uncertainties are combined via numerical integration mc technique which takes properly into account nongaussian distributed uncertainties the mean and deviation of the resulting distributions of the expected number of multijet background events for the baseline and search 
selections are taken as the central values and uncertainties of the final prediction as 
given in the last row of table these central values are slightly shifted compared to the 
nominal values owing to the asymmetrically distributed uncertainties

interpretation with simplified model spectra 

models for new physics can also be studied in more generic manner using simplified 
model spectra sms approach simplified models are designed to characterize 







experimental data in terms of small number of basic parameters they exploit the fact 
that at the lhc the kinematics of events involving strongly produced massive 
new particles are largely determined by the parton distribution functions and 
factors associated with and decays using these simplified models the 
experimental results can then be translated into any desired framework 
for the simplified models used in this paper it is assumed that the new particles 
are strongly produced in pairs whose decay chains ultimately result in stable weakly 
interacting massive particle denoted as lsp the particles produced in the hard interaction 
can be identified as partners of quarks and gluons in susy these would be the squarks 

and gluinos 
even though the sms are more generic in the following everything is 
phrased for simplicity in terms of names two benchmark simplified models 
are investigated for the number of jets and 
signature in this analysis 
gluinos where each gluino directly decays to two light quarks and the lsp and pairproduced squarks where each squark decays to one light quark and the lsp in figure 
the respective diagrams for these simplified models are drawn to limit the set of sms 
studied only few are chosen that can bracket the kinematic properties of the different 
final states for this reason the associated production is neglected 
the simplified models are simulated with the pythia generator the 
parton distribution functions and the parametrized cms detector simulation for 
each topology samples are generated for range of masses of the particles involved and 
thus more mass splittings are explored than in the cmssm where the ratio of the gluino 
and the lsp masses is approximately fixed 
in the following the measured cross section upper limits are compared to typical 
reference cross section from prospino in the case of squark 
pair production this reference cross section corresponds to the cross 
section with four light flavours included with the gluinos becoming nearly decoupled at 
tev this cross section is used to convert upper limits on the production cross section 
to reference limits on masses

acceptance and selection efficiency is shown within the simplified model space for gluino

minimal reliance on simulation the overall uncertainty on the resulting total background 
prediction is dominated by the statistical uncertainty

results are obtained for other tan values the results are also more generically interpreted 
in the context of simplified models where final states are described by the pair production

introduction 

searches for new physics at the tev energy scale are motivated by several considerations 
ranging from the strong astrophysical evidence for dark matter to theoretical issues 
associated with explaining the observed particle masses and their hierarchy in this 
paper we report results from search for new physics in collisions at 
energy of tev focusing on the signature with single isolated lepton 
electron or muon multiple energetic jets and large missing momentum transverse to 
the data sample 
the beam direction whose magnitude is denoted by the symbol 
was collected by the compact muon solenoid cms experiment during at the large 
hadron collider lhc and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 
the search signature arises naturally in several theoretical frameworks for new physics 
among them supersymmetry susy susy models predict spectrum of new particles with couplings identical to those of the standard model sm but with spins differing 
by half unit with respect to their sm partners in many models multiplicatively 
conserved quantum number parity is introduced constraining susy particles to be 
produced in pairs and susy particle decay chains to end with the lightest supersymmetric 
particle lsp in some scenarios the lsp is neutralino heavy electrically neutral 
weakly interacting particle with the characteristics required of candidate 
searches at the tevatron and lep have found no evidence as yet for 
susy particles demonstrating that if supersymmetry exists it is broken with susy 
particle masses typically greater than gev recently searches from the cms 
and atlas experiments have extended the sensitivity to higher mass scales 





signal regions and background determination 

ht 
background determination using ht and 
and lepton pt distributions 
background determination using the 





in particular atlas has reported constraints on susy models from search in the 
channel which is defined in similar manner to this analysis 
at the lhc relatively large cross sections for susy particle production up to tens of 
pb can arise from qcd processes leading to the production of gluinogluino and pairs the search signature 
reflects the complex decay chains of the heavy strongly coupled susy particles the 
isolated lepton indicates weak decay of heavy particle either boson or new 
particle large missing momentum transverse to the beam direction can be carried by 
neutrino or in the case of new physics by one or more heavy weakly interacting particles 
such as the lsp finally multiple jets can arise from quarks and gluons produced in 
the decay chains this signature arises in many susy models including the constrained 
minimal supersymmetric extension to the standard model cmssm which we use 
to interpret the results 
the susy signal is not characterized by any narrow peaks but rather by broad distributions that extend to higher values of the kinematic variables than those of the sm 
backgrounds these backgrounds arise primarily from the production of tt and 
qcd multijet events it is therefore critical to determine the extent of the tails of the sm 
background distributions we use methods that are primarily based on control samples 
in the data sometimes in conjunction with certain reliable information from simulated 
event samples 
two complementary methods are used to probe the event sample one focusing mainly 
and the other emphasizing the lepton transverse momentum pt and 

on jets and 

ht where ht is the scalar 
the first method uses two kinematic variables ht and 
sum of the jet pt values for all jets above certain threshold the yields in three control 
regions are combined to provide prediction for the total background in the signal region 
without differentiating among the backgrounds this method tests whether the behavior of 
is consistent with that expected from the sm 
the event sample with respect to jets and 
the second method which is ultimately used for the interpretation in terms of constraints on susy parameter space exploits the relationship between the lepton pt and 
distributions the dominant sm backgrounds are tt and events with 
the 

single isolated lepton or in these processes the lepton pt and the 
distributions are closely related because the lepton and neutrino are produced together in 
the decay the observed lepton spectrum with appropriate corrections can 
spectrum under the null sm hypothesis in contrast 
therefore be used to predict the 
are very different in many susy models where 
the distributions of lepton pt and 
the presence of two lsps effectively decouples the two distributions in such models the 
method is robust against potential signal contamination of the control regions smaller 
backgrounds from dilepton tt events where both bosons associated with the top quarks 
decay leptonically feeding down to the channel and from decays in 
both tt and events are estimated from additional control samples as is the qcd 
multijet background 
the two methods for probing the data provide broader picture of the event sample 
than single approach given the large range of potential signal models the use of multiple 



event samples and preselection 

this section describes the overall strategy of the analysis the event samples used and 
the preselection requirements the composition of the event sample is determined largely 
by the topological requirements of single isolated lepton either an electron 
or muon and at least four jets the requirement is critical for the 
rejection of qcd multijet processes which have very large cross sections while many 
lepton candidates are produced in the semileptonic decays of and hadrons from and 
decays in flight and from misidentification of hadrons the vast majority of these are 
embedded in hadronic jets and are rejected using the variable described 
below the initially very large background which is dominated by or 
is heavily suppressed by the requirement tt then emerges as the largest 
contribution to the background in the sample of events with moderate to large values of 
missing transverse momentum above approximately gev 





methods for the background determination provides valuable information to ensure that 
the event sample is comprehensively understood 
the cms detector described in detail in ref is multipurpose apparatus designed to study physics processes in collisions as well as broad 
range of phenomena in collisions the central element of cms is superconducting solenoid in length and in diameter within the magnet are in order 
of increasing radius from the beam pipe the and 
detectors for charged particle tracking lead tungstate crystal electromagnetic calorimeter 
for measurements of photons electrons and the electromagnetic component of jets and 
hadron calorimeter constructed from scintillating tiles and brass absorbers for 
measurements beyond the magnet is the muon system comprising cathodestrip and detectors interleaved with steel absorbers each detector system 
comprises subsystems that cover the central barrel and forward endcap regions 
in describing the angular distribution of particles and the acceptance of the detector 
we frequently make use of the pseudorapidity where the polar angle 
of the momentum vector is measured with respect to the axis of the cms 
coordinate system the axis points along the direction of the counterclockwise rotating 
beam the azimuthal angle is measured in plane perpendicular to this axis the 
separation between two momentum vectors in space is characterized by the quantity 

which is approximately invariant under lorentz boosts along 
the axis 
the paper is organized as follows the event selection requirements are described in 
section section begins with brief survey of the kinematic distributions comparing the 
data with simulated monte carlo mc event samples the methodologies for obtaining 
sm background estimates from control samples in the data are described and the observed 
yields in the data are compared with these estimates the systematic uncertainties are 
summarized in section finally the results interpretation and conclusions of the analysis 
are presented in sections and 





because the analysis is part of broad set of cms topological susy searches involving 
we veto events containing second candidate this procedure reduces 

the statistical overlap between the searches in different topologies provides clearer phenomenological interpretation of each search and in the channel suppresses 
sm backgrounds that produce two or more isolated leptons nevertheless tt backgrounds 
with dileptons can still feed into the sample and this contribution must be determined 
the 
particularly because the presence of two neutrinos can result in large values of 
background involving decays both from tt events and from direct production 
must also be determined 
the analysis procedures are designed by studying simulated event samples based on 
variety of generators in all cases except for certain susy scans discussed later the detector 
simulation is performed using the package qcd samples are generated with 
the pythia mc generator with tune the dominant background tt is 
studied with sample generated with madgraph the and 
processes are simulated with both madgraph and alpgen 
susy benchmark models are generated with pythia two models designated 
and are frequently used in cms because they have large cross sections and 
are accessible with small event samples is described by the universal scalar mass 
parameter gev the universal gaugino mass parameter gev the 
universal trilinear soft susy breaking parameter gev the ratio of the two 
vacuum expectation values tan and the sign of the higgs mixing 
parameter for the corresponding parameters are gev 
gev gev tan and the leading order cross sections for these 
models summed over all production processes are pb and pb the 
order cross sections are approximately pb and pb 
these benchmark models are beyond the exclusion limits of the tevatron and lep searches 
referenced in section and have recently been excluded by lhc searches ref 
they provide useful comparison points for searches in different channels we also perform 
scans over cmssm parameter space using large number of monte carlo samples in 
which the simulation is performed using cms fast simulation package to reduce the time 
associated with the detector simulation 
the data samples used in the analysis are recorded using trigger paths that directly 
require the presence of lepton above minimum pt threshold sometimes in conjunction 
with additional jet energy the basic muon trigger path is simple trigger 
requiring pt gev as the lhc luminosity increased above 
trigger was implemented requiring both pt gev and httrigger gev where 
httrigger is the scalar sum of the raw calorimeter jet et values measured at the trigger level 
for electrons higher trigger threshold is required pt gev 
the offline preselection requirements are designed to be simple and robust events are 
required to have at least one good reconstructed primary vertex at least four jets and 
exactly one isolated muon or exactly one isolated electron the jet and lepton selection 
criteria are specified below the primary vertex must satisfy set of quality requirements including zpv cm and cm where zpv and are the longitudinal 



signal regions and background determination 

we next survey the properties of the event sample after imposing the preselection require gev while 
ments described in the previous section and after further requiring 
requirement is far looser than that used in the final selection it nevertheless supthis 
presses much of the remaining qcd multijet background and brings the sample closer to 
the final composition dominated by tt and events the overall shapes of the 





and transverse distances of the primary vertex with respect to the nominal cms interaction point 
are reconstructed using algorithm which combines 
jets and 
vector is defined as the negative 
information from all components of the detector the 
of the vector sum of the transverse momenta of all the particles reconstructed and identified 
quantity itself is the magnitude of the 
vector 
by the algorithm the 
the jet clustering is performed using the clustering algorithm with distance 
parameter of corrections based on simulation are applied to the raw jet energies to 
establish relative uniform response across the detector in and an absolute calibrated response in pt additional corrections are applied to the data to take into account 
residual differences between the calibration in data and simulation the performance of cms jet reconstruction and the corrections are described in refs jet 
candidates are required to satisfy quality criteria that suppress noise and spurious energy 
deposits and each event must contain at least four jets with pt gev and 
in the muon channel the preselection requires single muon candidate satisfying 
pt gev and several requirements are imposed on the elements that 
form the muon candidate the reconstructed track must have at least hits in the silicon 
tracker with an impact parameter in the transverse plane with respect to the beam 
spot satisfying cm and an impact parameter dz with respect to the primary 
vertex along the beam direction satisfying dz cm to suppress background in 
which the muon originates from semileptonic decay of or quark in jet we require 
that it be spatially isolated from other energy in the event cone of size 
is constructed around the muon direction in space the muon isolation variable 
et pt is defined as the sum of the transverse energy et as measured 
in the electromagnetic and hadron calorimeters and the transverse momentum pt as 
measured in the silicon tracker of all reconstructed objects within this cone excluding 
the muon this quantity is used to compute the isolation relative to the muon transverse 
momentum which is required to satisfy finally the muon must satisfy 
with respect to all jets with pt gev and 
for the electron channel single electron candidate is required to satisfy pt 
gev and excluding the overlap region the 
relative isolation variable defined as in the muon case must satisfy in the 
barrel region and in the endcaps as well as set of quality and photonconversion rejection criteria events with two or more good lepton candidates are rejected 
for the reasons discussed above

where ht is given by eq we can construct set of control regions in the twodimensional kinematic space of ht ymet and use them to obtain background estimate 
signifin the signal region the quantity ymet can be interpreted as an approximate 
arising from jet 
icance in that the denominator is proportional to the uncertainty on 
mismeasurements 
the critical feature of these variables is that due to the lack of significant correlation in 
the kinematic regions and event samples used in this analysis their joint probability distribution is to good approximation simply the product of the individual 





our background predictions which rely primarily on control samples in the data however 
the approximate agreement between yields in data and simulation is first indication that 
the analysis methods will be applied to sample dominated by sm events 
figure shows the distributions from data and simulated event samples of three fun ht and lepton pt for 
damental quantities in the muon and electron channels 
the purpose of these comparisons the normalization of the tt sample is fixed by the integrated luminosity and the nlo cross section pb obtained 
using mcfm the qcd multijet component is fixed by the simula gev requirement the qcd yield is small and its uncertainty 
tion because of the 
does not substantially affect the comparison to allow for better comparison of the 
shapes of the distributions the normalization is adjusted so that the total event 
yields in data and simulation agree resulting in an increase by with respect to the 
inclusive order nnlo value nb obtained using 
fewz and summed over all three lepton flavors similar effect is observed in the 
cms tt cross section measurement in the channel as discussed in ref 
this scaling is applied only for these illustrative plots and is not relevant to the procedures 
used to obtain the background contributions for the actual measurement 
the overall shapes of these and many other distributions are in qualitative agreement 
with the simulation we have examined the pt distributions of the four leading jets the 
invariant mass distribution of the three leading jets the lepton isolation distributions 
system which 
the number of jets and the transverse mass of the 
corresponds to the boson in most sm background processes we conclude that the 
cores of the observed distributions are dominated by tt and events 
because the signal region involves the extreme tails of these distributions which are 
difficult to simulate the background predictions are based on control samples in the data 
rather than on simulated event samples the following sections describe these methods 
which further probe the detailed kinematic features of the event sample

the of tt dilepton events and either tt or events with 
decays although the background from qcd multijet events is very

control sample from dilepton and events with high pt leptons for the tight 
selection overall the lepton pt spectra from these processes are much softer than the 
distributions and the background predictions must be obtained from 
corresponding 
separate control samples

the method does not comprehensively predict all of the backgrounds to the 
sample and backgrounds arise from other sources including 
several categories of dilepton events events with decays either from tt or 
events and qcd multijet processes these contributions are also estimated using control 
samples in the data as discussed below the background from production and 
is very small for the loose selection and is negligible for the tight selection

all of the estimates of the dilepton backgrounds begin with control samples of

control samples in data in all cases care is required to ensure that the control sample is 
not contaminated by qcd background estimates for the backgrounds 
from tt and processes are based on similar procedure as that used for the dilepton 
backgrounds but in this case the sample itself is used as the control sample 
we define correction factors for the dilepton and background predictions in 
the loose selection these corrections range from to with uncertainty 
for the tight selection the correction factors are typically with large 
systematic uncertainty this correction has almost no effect on the final result because the 
background from these sources is small compared to the and backgrounds 
see tables and 
background from qcd multijet events is suppressed to level well below one event 
in both the loose and tight selections to estimate the qcd background we use the 
and the relative lepton isolation section 
distribution of 
gev we 
which are essentially uncorrelated using sample with 
measure the ratio of the number of leptons passing the isolation requirement 

to the number in an isolation sideband events that pass the 
requirements for the signal region but are in the isolation sideband are then scaled by this 
measured ratio 
the precision of the qcd background prediction is limited by the small number of 
region two such muon events are found with 

sideband leptons in the 
gev requirement while there are no 
gev one of which also passes the 
electron events this procedure tends to overestimate the qcd background because events 
isolation sideband and the 
from electroweak and tt processes can contaminate the 
sample in addition for the tight selection the measurement is performed 
isolated 
using loosened ht requirement of gev for muons and gev for electrons since 
the isolation sideband is sparsely populated despite these potential overestimates the 
background predictions and their uncertainties listed in tables and are small well 
below one event 

although very few qcd background events contribute to the signal region at high 
such events can affect the control region used to estimate the background from

tt and events that control sample is selected without 
say 
gev would tend to remove events with 
requiring minimum value of 
tail the qcd 
leptons which are precisely those used to predict the 
contamination in the muon sample is very small but there is significant contamination 
we have therefore used only the pt spectrum 
from qcd in the electron sample at low 
from the muon control sample to predict the rates for both the electron and muon signal 
regions the scaling from the muon to the electron samples is obtained by fitting their ratio 
gev with systematic uncertainties evaluated 
in the data over the range 
by varying the fit range the resulting correction factor is 
consistent with the value obtained using simulated event samples 
in summary the background yields listed in tables and are consistent with the 
total background predicted in each selection for both the electron and muon channels in 
the loose selection muon events are observed in data compared with 

predicted while electron events are observed in data compared with 
predicted in the tight selection muon events are observed in data compared with 
predicted while electron events are observed compared with 
predicted the interpretation of these results in terms of susy models is discussed in 
section 



systematic uncertainties 





this section discusses the systematic uncertainties associated with the ht vs ymet and the 
methods the uncertainties fall into two main categories the uncertainties 
on the background estimates and the uncertainties on the overall acceptance and efficiency 
factors that are used to convert the observed yields into upper limits on susy cross sections 
the ht vs ymet method predicts the background yield in the signal region as 
function of the yields in the control regions and the systematic uncertainty 
arises from the possibility of correlation between the kinematic variables and 
can be expressed in terms of small departures of the quantity 
from unity monte carlo simulation predicts values of close to unity for tt and 
production as well as for the sum of all backgrounds as an additional check 
this behavior of has also been verified for the samples which are not used in 
the analysis 
we have evaluated the effect on from an extensive list of uncertainties reconstruction energy scales the resolution the 
related uncertainties include the jet and 
amount of energy in the calorimeter not clustered into jets the jet reconstruction efficiency 
the scale and the pt dependence of the efficiency uncertainties 
under consideration were related to the background composition tt vs to the 
amount of qcd background subtracted from each control region and to the parton distribution functions the small deviation of the central value of from unity predicted by 
the simulation has been added as an additional uncertainty these sources of systematic 
uncertainties are taken to be uncorrelated and the contributions are added in quadrature 
for the loose selection the total systematic uncertainties affecting the background prediction in the muon and electron channels are and respectively the corresponding 
numbers for the tight selection are and 
the systematic uncertainties on the background predictions are substantially larger and they increase from the loose to the tight selection the dominant 
energy scale if this scale shifts relative 
uncertainty is associated with the jet and 
threshold for the signal 
to the lepton pt scale the predicted number of events above the 
region will change the uncertainty on this scale propagates to uncertainty for 
the loose selection and uncertainty for the tight selection 
spectrum is 
the precision with which the lepton spectrum prediction matches the 
determined by set of related effects as described in section the helicity fractions 
for bosons produced in tt events are predicted in the sm to high precision when these 
uncertainties are propagated through the analysis the effect on the background prediction 
is negligible as test we have varied the polarization factors through range that is 

about ten times the theoretical uncertainties quoted in ref this leads to only 
effect for the loose selection and effect for the tight selection we have also varied the 
pt spectrum to study the effect of the boost on any differences arising from the 
polarizations this variation is constrained by the agreement between data and simulation 
for the pt spectrum and leads to loose and tight uncertainties on the 
background yield in addition we vary the tt cross section by and the cross 
section by and measure the effect on the background prediction in simulated event 
samples for loose for tight selection 

the systematic uncertainty arising from the possible incorrect modeling of the pt 
dependence of the lepton reconstruction and identification efficiency is estimated to be 
the effect of potential mismodeling of jet reconstruction efficiencies is found 
to be negligible the total systematic uncertainties on the method for 
predicting the background is for the loose selection and for the 
tight selection these do not include the uncertainties on the separate estimates for the 
dilepton and backgrounds based on control samples these additional predictions are 
assigned systematic uncertainty based on tests with simulated samples including both 
the statistical uncertainty due to finite simulated event samples and any observed shift 
with respect to the true values 
resolution smearing in simulated tt events using simulated 
the effect of the 
templates is to increase the background prediction by about for the loose 
qcd 
selection the smearing from the data has been seen to increase the background prediction 
slightly more by about we have increased the size of the template binning in ht by 
factors of two and five and recomputed the resolution smearing in each case the effects are 
negligible demonstrating that the prediction is insensitive to the details of the templates 
to translate from the observed event yields to cross section limits we must incorporate 
the effects of the signal efficiencies and acceptance these quantities are taken from the 
simulated event samples with performed using the data as validation the 
uncertainties include those on the modeling in simulation of the lepton trigger and iden energy scales in the 
tification efficiencies on the jet and 
method on the possible variation of parton density functions negligible and on the luminosity the total systematic uncertainty on the efficiency and acceptance is 





to account for the polarization uncertainties we have chosen three variations of the 
polarization fractions variation on for both and together this 
is equivalent to an approximately variation of the individual polarization fractions 
variation of and with constant sum for the polarization holding the 
polarization fixed and and variation of the longitudinal polarization 
fraction for both and each variation is applied in the same manner in 
three bins of pt gev gev and gev we do not vary the 
polarization of events with pt gev since these have negligible contribution 
to the selected event sample the sum of all three variations in quadrature yields 
systematic uncertainty for the loose selection and uncertainty for the tight selection 



results and interpretation 





both of the methods used to determine the sm background predict yields that are compatible with the observed number of events in the absence of signal we proceed to set 
exclusion limits on susy parameter space 
the potential signal contamination of the control samples in the data is model dependent and must be assessed separately for each hypothesis we have performed 
scan over cmssm model points and have determined the number of such events that 
enter the control regions of our measurements for the method the contamination is small events on average however the method using control regions 
in the ht vs ymet plane suffers much greater contamination of the control regions 
especially for models with large cross sections for the purpose of setting limits on the 
cmssm we have therefore used the values obtained from the method 
combining the yields in the method from the and channels we 
observe events in the loose selection and events in the tight selection the predicted 
sm background is events and events for the loose and tight selections 
respectively because the muon spectrum is used as control sample for obtaining the 
background in both the and channels as discussed in section the 
combined prediction reflects the fact that the uncertainties between these two channels are 
highly correlated applying the method which takes into account 
the number of events in the control samples using the profile likelihood ratio to handle 
nuisance parameters yields confidence level cl upper limit of signal events 
loose selection and signal events tight selection the central value and range of 
the expected limits are obtained by applying the same method to mc 
for comparison the susy model predicts events for the loose selection and 
events for the tight selection and channels combined the model for 
which the yields are events loose and events tight is at 
the edge of the sensitivity of the analysis 
to obtain more comprehensive result we perform scans of cmssm models to determine whether given set of parameters is excluded the monte carlo samples are 
initially generated using cross sections the predicted yields are corrected using nlo cross sections evaluated with prospino figure shows 
the limit curves resulting from the loose selection evaluated in the vs plane with 
the values of the remaining cmssm parameters fixed at tan and 
the corresponding curves for the tight selection which exclude larger region are shown 
in figure for reference the plots include curves of constant gluino and squark masses 
the lines of constant gluino mass are approximately horizontal with 
the lines of constant squark mass are strongly curved in the vs plane the 
total signal cross section decreases as function of and roughly following the 
contours 
the signal efficiency is defined for each model as the number of events passing the 
selection divided by the total number of susy events generated in 
the simulation summing over all decay chains this definition of efficiency therefore

conclusions 


using sample of collisions at tev corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of we have performed search for new physics with the experimental 
signature of at least four jets an isolated lepton and large missing transverse 
momentum the overall shapes of the kinematic distributions observed in data are consistent with expectations from sm simulated event samples indicating that the sample is 
dominated by tt and events 
to probe for new physics control samples in the data are used to predict the background contributions in the signal region the primary motivation for this approach is to 
avoid the direct use of simulated background event samples for predicting the extreme tails 
of kinematic distributions the first background determination method focuses on the jets 

using the space of ht and 
ht three control regions are 
and 
defined in data from which one predicts the sm background in the fourth region this 

ht and hence is most sensitive to signal conregion has both high ht and high 
tribution the observed event yield in the signal region is consistent with this prediction 
based on the control samples in the data 
the second method relies on the close relationship between two fundamental observ distribution in the dominant sm background 
ables the lepton pt distribution and the 
backgrounds with single isolated lepton this connection arises from the fact that the 
lepton and neutrino are produced together in the decay of the boson for both 
tt and events smaller backgrounds from the of tt dilepton events from 
decays in tt or events and from qcd multijet processes are also estimated 
from control samples in the data in the muon channel we observe two events in the high signal region tight selection as compared with sm events 

predicted in the electron channel no events are observed as compared with 
sm events predicted the systematic uncertainties on the background predictions are 
correlated and the total background prediction is events 





incorporates the many different branching fractions leading to final states 
and it also includes the loss in efficiency associated with the dilepton veto the efficiency 
increases with but is relatively uniform as function of in the tight selection 
the efficiency in the combined and channels is roughly at gev for the 
benchmark model the efficiency is in the loose selection and 
in the tight selection if one were simply to require reconstructed or satisfying 
the acceptance requirements the efficiency for would be 
the exclusion plots show the observed limits as well as the expected limits and the 
expected limits one standard deviation the loose selection has 
smaller band and in fact provides stronger exclusion of the part of the 
range the small dips in the exclusion limits in the range gev arise from 
corresponding dips in the efficiency curves the falloff in the exclusion limits around 
gev is due to the decrease in the cross section the tight selection excludes gluino 
masses below gev for below gev in the context of the cmssm framework 

finally we interpret these results in the framework of the cmssm reporting exclusion 
regions as function of and for tan the tight selection excludes gluino 
masses below gev for below gev in the context of the cmssm framework

introduction 

in this paper we describe search for physics beyond the standard model bsm in 
sample of collisions at energy of tev the data sample 
was collected with the compact muon solenoid cms detector at the large hadron 
collider lhc between march and november of and corresponds to an integrated 
luminosity of 
the bsm signature in this search is motivated by three general considerations first 
new particles predicted by bsm physics scenarios are expected to be heavy since they have 
so far eluded detection second bsm physics signals with high enough cross sections to be 
observed in our current dataset are expected to be produced strongly resulting in significant 
hadronic activity third astrophysical evidence for dark matter suggests that the 
mass of massive particles is of the order of the electroweak symmetry 
breaking scale such particles if produced in pp collisions could escape detection and give 
rise to an apparent imbalance in the event transverse energy we therefore focus on the 
miss an example of specific bsm scenario 
region of high missing transverse energy et 
is provided by conserving supersymmetric susy models in which new heavy 
particles are and subsequently undergo cascade decays producing hadronic 
jets and leptons these cascade decays may terminate in the production of weaklymiss 
interacting massive particles resulting in large et 





introduction 



cms detector 

the central feature of the cms apparatus is superconducting solenoid in length 
and in diameter which provides an axial magnetic field of within the field 
volume are several particle detection systems charged particle trajectories are measured 
by silicon pixel and silicon strip trackers covering in azimuth and in 
pseudorapidity defined as where is the polar angle of the trajectory of 





the results reported in this paper are part of broad program of bsm searches in 
miss characterized by the number and type of leptons in the final 
events with jets and et 
state here we describe search for events containing isolated lepton pairs 
miss results from complementary 
in addition to the jets and et 
search with no electrons or muons in the final state have already been reported in ref 
our analysis strategy is as follows in order to select dilepton events we use highpt lepton triggers and preselection based on that of the tt cross section measurement 
in the dilepton channel good agreement is found between this data sample and 
predictions from sm monte carlo mc simulations in terms of the event yields and shapes 
of various kinematic distributions because bsm physics is expected to have large hadronic 
miss as discussed above we define signal region with requirements on these 
activity and et 
quantities to select about of dilepton tt events as predicted by mc the observed 
event yield in the signal region is compared with the predictions from two independent 
background estimation techniques based on data control samples as well as with sm and 
bsm mc expectations finally the robustness of the result is confirmed by an independent 
analysis based on hadronic activity triggers different reconstruction and 
complementary background estimation method 
no specific bsm physics scenario particular susy model has been used to 
optimize the search in order to illustrate the sensitivity of the search simplified and 
practical model of susy breaking the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of 
the standard model cmssm is used the cmssm is described by five parameters the universal scalar and gaugino mass parameters and respectively the 
universal trilinear soft susy breaking parameter the ratio of the vacuum expectation 
values of the two higgs doublets tan and the sign of the higgs mixing parameter 
throughout the paper two cmssm parameter sets referred to as and are 
used to illustrate possible cmssm yields the parameter values defining are 
gev both and 
have tan and in the scenario the squarks and gluinos have 
masses in the range and the lightest susy particle is 
the lightest neutralino with mass of these two scenarios are 
beyond the exclusion reach of previous searches performed at the tevatron and lep they 
miss 
were recently excluded by search performed at cms in events with jets and et 
based on the same data sample used for this search in this analysis the and 
scenarios serve as benchmarks which may be used to allow comparison of the sensitivity 
with other analyses 

the particle with respect to the counterclockwise proton beam direction crystal electromagnetic calorimeter and hadronic calorimeter surround the tracking 
volume providing energy measurements of electrons and hadronic jets muons are identified and measured in detectors embedded in the steel return yoke outside 
the solenoid the detector is nearly hermetic allowing energy balance measurements in 
the plane transverse to the beam direction trigger system selects the most 
interesting pp collision events for use in physics analysis more detailed description of 
the cms detector can be found elsewhere 

event selection 

samples of mc events are used to guide the design of the analysis these events are generated using either the pythia or madgraph event generators they 
are then simulated using model of the cms detector and finally 
reconstructed and analyzed using the same software as is used to process collision data 
we apply preselection based on that of the tt cross section measurement in the 
dilepton channel events with two isolated leptons or 
are selected at least one of the leptons must have pt and both must 
have pt and the electrons muons must have in events 
with more than two such leptons the two leptons with the highest pt are selected events 
with an or pair with invariant mass between and or below 
are removed in order to suppress dy 
events as well as 
low mass dilepton resonances 
events are required to pass at least one of set of or 
triggers the efficiency for events containing two leptons passing the analysis selection to 
pass at least one of these triggers is very high in excess of for dilepton events 
because leptons produced in the decays of particles such as hadrons containing and quarks are nearly always inside jets they can be suppressed by requiring 
the leptons to be isolated in space from other particles that carry substantial amount 
of transverse momentum the details of the lepton isolation measurement are given in 
ref in brief cone is constructed of size around the 
lepton momentum direction the lepton relative isolation is then quantified by summing 
the transverse energy as measured in the calorimeters and the transverse momentum as 
measured in the silicon tracker of all objects within this cone excluding the lepton and 
dividing by the lepton transverse momentum the resulting quantity is required to be less 
than rejecting the large background arising from qcd production of jets 
we require the presence of at least two jets with pt and separated by from leptons passing the analysis selection with pt the 
clustering algorithm with is used for jet clustering jets are reconstructed using calorimeter information and their energies are corrected using reconstructed 
tracks the event is required to satisfy ht gev where ht is defined as the 
miss in the 
scalar sum of the transverse energies of the selected jets in addition the et 
event is required to exceed gev several techniques are used in cms for calculating

predicted yield of the abcd method to take into account uncertainties from contributions 
of backgrounds other than dilepton tt finite mc statistics in the closure test 
and variation of the boundaries between the abcd regions based on the uncertainty in 
the hadronic energy scale 
the second background estimate henceforth referred to as the dilepton transverse 
momentum pt method is based on the idea that in dilepton tt events the pt 
distributions of the charged leptons and neutrinos from decays are related because of the 
common boosts from the top and decays this relation is governed by the polarization 
of the which is well understood in top decays in the sm and can therefore be 
reliably accounted for we then use the observed pt distribution to model the pt 
miss thus we use the number of observed events 
distribution which is identified with et 

with ht gev and pt ht to predict the number of background 

miss in practice two corrections 
events with ht gev and et 

must be applied to this prediction as described below 
miss gev requirement in the preselection 
the first correction accounts for the et 
which is needed to reduce the dy background we rescale the prediction by factor 
equal to the inverse of the fraction of events passing the preselection which also satisfy 
the requirement pt this correction factor is determined from mc and is 
the second correction kc is associated with the known polarization of the 
which introduces difference between the pt and pt distributions the correction 
kc also takes into account detector effects such as the hadronic energy scale and resolution 
miss but not the total correction factor is 
which affect the et 



where the uncertainty is dominated by the uncertainty in the hadronic energy scale 
all background estimation methods based on data are in principle subject to signal 
contamination in the control regions which tends to decrease the significance of signal 
which may be present in the data by increasing the background prediction in general it 
is difficult to quantify these effects because we do not know what signal may be present in 
the data having two independent methods in addition to expectations from mc adds 
redundancy because signal contamination can have different effects in the different control 
regions for the two methods for example in the extreme case of bsm signal with 
miss an excess of events might be seen in the abcd 
identical distributions of pt and et 
method but not in the pt method 
backgrounds in which one or both leptons do not originate from electroweak decays 
leptons are assessed using the method of ref lepton is 
lepton candidate originating from within jet such as lepton from semileptonic or 
decays muon pion misidentified as an electron or an unidentified 
photon conversion estimates of the contributions to the signal region from pure multijet 
qcd with two leptons and in jets with one lepton in addition 
to the lepton from the decay of the are derived separately we find 
and 

for the multijet qcd and contributions respectively and thus consider 
these backgrounds to be negligible 
backgrounds from dy and from processes with two vector bosons and single top are 
negligible compared to dilepton tt

dilepton search 

the result of section is in similar kinematic region with an independent 
search relying on different trigger path different methods for reconstruction and different background estimation method this search is directed at bsm 
scenarios in which decay chains of pair of new heavy particles produce an excess of 
and events over events for example 
in the context of the cmssm this excess may be caused by decays of neutralinos and 
bosons to lepton pairs for the benchmark scenario the fraction 
of events in the signal region discussed below is 
the dominant background in this search is also dilepton tt for which such an excess 
does not exist because the flavours of the two leptons are uncorrelated therefore the rate 
of tt decays with two leptons may be estimated from the number of oppositeflavour events after correcting for the ratio of muon to electron selection efficiencies 
this method actually estimates the contribution of any uncorrelated pair of leptons including events where the two leptons decay leptonically this method will 
also subtract any bsm signal producing lepton pairs of uncorrelated flavour 
events with two leptons with pt are selected because the lepton triggers 
are not fully efficient for events with two leptons of pt the data sample for this 
analysis is selected with hadronic triggers based on the scalar sum of the transverse energies 
of all jets reconstructed from calorimeter signals with pt the event is required 
to pass at least one of set of hadronic triggers with transverse energy thresholds ranging 
from to gev the efficiency of this set of triggers with respect to the analysis 





benchmark models for others that depend strongly on the kinematic properties of the 
event the systematic uncertainties must be quoted model by model 
the systematic uncertainty in the lepton acceptance consists of two parts the trigger 
efficiency uncertainty and the identification and isolation uncertainty the trigger efficiency 
for two leptons of pt with one lepton of pt is close to we 
estimate the efficiency uncertainty to be few percent mostly in the low pt region using 
samples of for dilepton tt and the trigger efficiency uncertainties 
are found to be less than we verify that the mc reproduces the lepton identification 
and isolation efficiencies in data using samples of the data and mc efficiencies are 
found to be consistent within 
another significant source of systematic uncertainty is associated with the jet and 
miss energy scale the impact of this uncertainty is dependent final states 
et 
miss are less sensitive than final states 
characterized by very large hadronic activity and et 
miss and 
where the et 
are typically close to the minimum requirements applied to these 
quantities to be more quantitative we have used the method of ref to evaluate the 
systematic uncertainties in the acceptance for tt and for the two benchmark susy points 
using uncertainty in the hadronic energy scale for tt the uncertainty is for 
and the uncertainties are and respectively 
the uncertainty in the integrated luminosity is 

selection is greater than in addition to the trigger we require ht gev where 
ht in this analysis is defined as the scalar sum of the transverse energies of all selected 
jets with pt and within an increased pseudorapidity range in line with 
miss and leptons are reconstructed with the particle 
the trigger requirement the jets et 
flow technique the resulting performance of the selection of leptons and jets does 
not differ significantly from the selection discussed in section 
miss gev this signal rethe signal region is defined by additionally requiring et 
gion is chosen such that approximately one sm event is expected in our current data sample 

the jets and qcd multijet contributions where at least one of the two leptons is 
secondary lepton from heavy flavour decay or jet misidentified as lepton 
leptons are estimated from fit to the lepton isolation distribution after relaxing the 
isolation requirement on the leptons contributions from other sm backgrounds such as 
miss requirement 
dy or processes with two gauge bosons are strongly suppressed by the et 
and are expected to be negligible 
we first estimate the number of sm events in region with ht 
miss gev in order to cope with the lower requirement we use the 
gev and et 

same lepton trigger sample as described in section in this region we observe 
candidates and predict lepton events from the fit to 
the lepton isolation distribution this results in an estimate of tt events in the 
channel using the efficiency ratio this estimate is then converted into prediction 
for the number of events in the ee and channels 
table shows the number of expected sm background events in the control region for the mc as well as the prediction from the background estimation techniques 
based on data there are total of events in good agreement with the 
prediction of events we thus proceed to the signal region selection 
the sm background predictions in the signal region from the and 
lepton methods are summarized in table we find one event in the signal 
region in the channel with prediction of leptons of and thus 
predict 
events using poisson statistical uncertainties in the data we 
find no events in agreement with the prediction in contrast with 
and expected events for the benchmark points and respectively the 
predicted background from leptons is negligible 
table demonstrates the sensitivity of this approach we observe comparable yields 
of the same benchmark points as for the lepton trigger search where of 
the events are common to both searches for and either approach would have 
given an excess in the presence of signal 





the lepton selection efficiencies are measured using the resonance as discussed in 
section these efficiencies are known with systematic uncertainty of the selection 
efficiencies of isolated leptons are different in the and jets samples the ratio of 
muon to electron efficiencies however is found to differ by less than in the mc 
simulations and corresponding systematic uncertainty is assigned to this ratio this

limits on new physics 

the three background predictions for the lepton trigger search discussed in section 
are in good agreement with each other and with the observation of one event in the signal 
region bayesian confidence level cl upper limit on the number of nonsm events in the signal region is determined to be using background prediction of 
nbg events and model of nuisance parameter integration the 
upper limit is not very sensitive to nbg and its uncertainty this generic upper limit is 
not corrected for the possibility of signal contamination in the control regions this is 
justified because the two independent background estimation methods based on data agree 
and are also consistent with the sm mc prediction moreover no evidence for 
contributions in the control regions is observed table and figure this bound rules 
out the benchmark susy scenario for which the number of expected signal events 
is while the scenario predicts events the uncertainties in the 
and event yields arise from energy scale luminosity and lepton efficiency as 
discussed in section

additional information for model testing 

other models of new physics in the dilepton final state can be confronted in an approximate way by simple studies that compare the expected number of events in 
with the upper limits from section the key ingredients of such studies are the 
kinematic requirements described in this paper the lepton efficiencies and the detector 
miss the muon identification efficiency is the electron 
responses for ht and et 
identification efficiency varies approximately linearly from at pt to 
for pt the lepton isolation efficiency depends on the lepton momentum as 
well as on the jet activity in the event in tt events it varies approximately linearly from 





for the search using hadronic activity triggers discussed in section no 
events are observed and the corresponding bayesian cl upper limit on 
the yield is events this bound rules out the benchmark susy scenarios 
and for which the numbers of expected signal events are and 
respectively 
we also quote the result more generally in the context of the cmssm the bayesian 
cl limit in the plane for tan and is shown in figure 
the lepton and hadronic trigger searches have similar sensitivity to the cmssm 
here we choose to show results based on the lepton trigger search the susy 
particle spectrum is calculated using softsusy and the signal events are generated 
at leading order lo with pythia nlo cross sections obtained with the program 
prospino are used to calculate the observed exclusion contour at each point in the 
plane the acceptance uncertainty is calculated by summing in quadrature the 
miss energy scale using the procedure discussed in section the 
uncertainties from jet and et 
uncertainty in the nlo cross section due to the choice of factorization and renormalization 
scale and the uncertainty from the parton distribution function pdf for 
estimated from the envelope provided by the error sets the luminosity uncertainty and dilepton selection efficiency uncertainty are also included giving total relative 
acceptance uncertainty which varies in the range point is considered to be excluded if the nlo yield exceeds the cl bayesian upper limit calculated with this 
acceptance uncertainty using model for the nuisance parameter integration 
the limit curves do not include the effect of signal contamination in the control regions 
we have verified that this has negligible impact on the excluded regions in figure 
the excluded regions for the cdf search for jets missing energy final states 
were obtained for tan while those from were obtained for tan each 
with approximately of data and for the regions are based 
on searches for sleptons and charginos the exclusion limit valid for tan 

and obtained from search for associated production of charginos

presented in figure the results of our search and of the trilepton search are strongly

summary 

we have presented search for bsm physics in the dilepton final state using 
data sample of collisions at tev energy corresponding to 
an integrated luminosity of recorded by the cms detector in the search 
focused on dilepton events with large missing transverse energy and significant hadronic 
activity motivated by many models of bsm physics such as supersymmetric models good 
agreement with standard model predictions was found both in terms of event yields and 











shapes of various relevant kinematic distributions in the absence of evidence for bsm 
physics we have set upper limits on the contributions to the signal regions the 
result was interpreted in the context of the cmssm parameter space and the excluded 
region was found to exceed those set by previous searches at the tevatron and lep experiments information on the acceptance and efficiency of the search was also provided to 
allow testing the exclusion of specific models of bsm physics

supersymmetry susy in particular the version based 
on breaking is of particular theoretical interest for physics beyond the standard model 
sm supersymmetry stabilizes the mass of the sm 
higgs boson drives the grand unification of forces and 
incorporates dark matter candidates within its framework 
previous searches for susy with breaking were performed by using minimal model 
as benchmark in that model in order to reduce the 
number of free parameters several assumptions including 
gaugino mass unification are made these assumptions 
lead to mass hierarchy in which strongly interacting 
susy partners are much heavier than the lightest chargino 
and neutralino for example the current best lower limit on 
the neutralino mass of gev corresponds to gluino 
and squark mass limits of well above tev in the more 
general case the masses of strongly interacting susy 
partners can be much lighter leading to large production 
cross sections at the lhc and allowing even at low 
integrated luminosity for the exploration of parameter 
space inaccessible at previous colliders 
in this letter we consider general 
ggm susy scenario with the gravitino as the 
lightest susy particle and the lightest neutralino as the 
nlsp in the following it is assumed that 
the neutralino decays promptly to gravitino and photon 
cases with either large neutralino lifetime or large 
branching fraction into and gravitino are not considered in this letter the gravitino escapes detection leading

the susy signal can be mimicked in several ways 
irreducible backgrounds from sm processes such as 


and are negligible the main 
backgrounds arise from sm processes with misidentified 
photons mismeasured emiss 
the dominant contriin qcd 
bution comes from mismeasurement of emiss 

processes such as direct diphoton photon plus jets and 
multijet production with jets mimicking photons in the 
latter two cases this background is referred to as the qcd 
background the strategy for determining this background 
is to use control samples that are kinematically similar to 
the candidate sample and that can be reasonably assumed 
to have no significant genuine emiss 
two such samples are 
used the first is sample containing two fake photons 
referred to as the ff sample below comprising qcd 
multijet events the second ee sample contains events 
with two electrons with invariant mass between and 
gev and is dominated by ee decays 
the et resolution for electrons and fake photons is 
similar to the resolution for photons and is much better 
resothan the resolution for hadronic energy so the emiss 

lution is dominated by the latter the events in both control 
samples are reweighted to reproduce the diphoton transverse energy distribution in the candidate sample and 
therefore the transverse energy of the hadronic recoil 
against the diphoton system the reweighting factors range 
distributions 
from to the shapes of the emiss 

obtained from both control samples are identical within 
the statistical and systematic uncertainties and are used to 
predict the emiss 
background by normalizing to the number 

of events with emiss 
gev in the candidate sample 

the second background comes from events with real 
emiss 
it is dominated by events with genuine or fake 
photon and that decays into neutrino and an electron 
with the latter misidentified as photon this background 
is referred to as the electroweak background an electron is 
misidentified as photon if it satisfies all the photon 
selection criteria but has no matching hit pattern in the 
pixel detector to model this background an candidate 
sample is defined selected the same way as the sample 
but requiring at least one electron and at least one photon 
instead of at least two photons this sample is thus enriched with and plus jets events with real emiss 

similar to those in the candidate sample the probability fe to misidentify an electron as photon is measured

events an additional conservative systematic uncertainty 
of events is assigned by taking the largest difference 
between the average and the individual measurements

the efficiency for susy events to satisfy the selection 
criteria is determined by applying correction factors derived from the data to the mc simulation of the signal 
since there exists no large clean sample of isolated photons 
in the data we rely on similarities between the detector 
response to electrons and photons to extract the photon 
efficiency the difference between the efficiencies for 
electrons and photons according to the mc simulation is 
the ratio of the electron efficiency from ee

the pixel match to the corresponding electron mc efficiencies gives an mc efficiency scale factor of

several orders of magnitude larger than the typical signal

the kinematic variable first introduced in 
refs is used in the selection to efficiently reject 
events either without significant

energy mismeasurements while retaining large sensitivity to new physics with genuine 
signatures for events 


with two jets the variable is defined as et mt 

et ht ht where et is the transverse energy of 
the jet and mt is the transverse mass of the 
dijet system for perfectly measured dijet event with 
et et and jets back to back in and in the limit 
of large jet momenta compared to their masses the value of

transverse energies of jets is smaller than

the two jets are not back to back and balancing genuine 

for events with three or more jets dijet system is formed 
by combining the jets in the event into two pseudojets 
the total et of each of the two pseudojets is calculated as 
the scalar sum of the measured et of contributing jets the 
combination chosen is the one that minimizes the et 
difference between the two pseudojets this simple clustering criterion provides the best separation between qcd

the analysis makes use of two additional data samples

first 
jets sample is recorded with the hadronic trigger condition 
described above the event selection following closely the 
prescription described in ref requires single isolated muon with pt gev in the final state and the 
transverse mass of the muon and system to be larger 
than gev to ensure sample rich in bosons the 
muon is required to be separated from the closest jet in the 
event by and such that the distance 

second jets sample is selected 
using dedicated photon trigger condition requiring 
localized large energy deposit in the ecal with pt 
gev and that satisfies loose photon identification and 
isolation criteria the offline selection requires 
single photon to be reconstructed with pt gev 
satisfying tight isolation criteria and with 
minimum distance to any jet of for these selection criteria the photon trigger condition is found to be 
fully efficient 
the hadronic signal region is divided into eight bins of 
ht two bins of width gev in the range ht 
gev five bins of width gev in the range 
ht gev and final open bin ht gev as 
in ref jet et thresholds are scaled down from their 
nominal values in the lowest two ht bins to maintain jet 
multiplicities and thus comparable event kinematics topologies and background composition throughout the entire 
ht range the background estimation methods described 
below are combined in the statistical interpretation of the 
observed data yields to provide single prediction of the 
sm background in each ht bin of the hadronic signal 
region with respect to ref these refinements provide 
greater sensitivity across broader susy parameter space 
and in the context of cmssm up to states 
the jets data sample provides an estimate of the 
contributions from top quark and production leading to 
jets final states still remaining in each ht bin of the 
hadronic signal region after all selection criteria are applied factors obtained from simulation are then used 
to translate the yields in the jets sample to estimates in 
each ht bin of the hadronic signal region these factors are 
found to be only weakly dependent on ht ranging from 
at low ht to at high ht conservative uncertainties on all the parameters entering these translation factors 
are assigned the total systematic uncertainty is estimated 
to be dominated by the uncertainty on the efficiency 
for vetoing leptons the remaining irreducible background 
of jets events in the hadronic signal sample is 
estimated from jets events these two processes have 
similar kinematic properties when the photon is ignored 
while the latter has larger production cross 
section translation factors that account for the ratio of 
cross sections for jets and jets and their 
relative acceptances are obtained from simulation and

are used to estimate the number of jets events in 
each ht bin of the hadronic signal region as is the case of 
the jets sample these translation factors are only 
weakly dependent on ht ranging from at low ht to 
at high ht the main systematic uncertainties on 
these factors are associated with the ratio of cross sections 
between jets and jets in the simulation 
the efficiency for photon identification and 
the purity of the photon selection which add up in 
quadrature to these uncertainty estimates are verified 
by predicting the number of events in each ht 
bin using the sample the requirement of 
exactly two jets suppresses the top quark contribution in 
the muon sample thus leaving relatively pure jets 
sample that is kinematically similar to the jets 
sample the predicted and observed event yields are consistent within the assigned systematic uncertainties 
furthermore the ht dependence of the ratio is 
exploited to constrain the sm background estimate for 
each ht bin this ratio is defined as the number of events 
with above and below threshold value of for 
given bin in ht the denominator of the ratio is always 
dominated by events from qcd multijet production and is 
measured in data with samples selected by the set of 
prescaled ht trigger conditions the chosen threshold 
ensures that for given bin in ht the numerator of the 
ratio is dominated by events from sm processes with 
genuine 
from neutrinos with no significant contribution from qcd multijet production as observed in 
ref this property leads to being independent of 

ht the remaining backgrounds are those with genuine 
from associated production of top quarks or with 
jets by relaxing the threshold to values lower than 
the numerator is instead dominated by mismeasured qcd 
multijet events and an exponential dependence of on 
ht is observed the behaviors of and are 
observed in data and simulation to be robust against the 
effects of multiple pp collisions per beam crossing 
pileup in the statistical interpretation of the analysis 
is modeled as superposition of 
ht contribution from sm processes with 
genuine 
and an exponentially falling contribution to 
accommodate any potential qcd contamination the latter is considered even though no evidence of significant 
qcd contamination is found in the hadronic signal region 
to obtain an accurate and consistent prediction of the 
sm background simultaneous binned likelihood fit using 
information from all three data samples is performed the 
fit maximizes the likelihood ltotal lhadronic

search for supersymmetry with conservation in collisions at 
energy of tev is presented the data correspond to an integrated luminosity of collected by 
the cms experiment at the lhc the search is performed in events with jets and missing 
transverse energy characteristic of the decays of heavy squarks and gluinos the primary 
background from standard model multijet production is reduced by several orders of magnitude to 
negligible level by the application of set of robust kinematic requirements with this selection the 
data are consistent with the standard model backgrounds namely jet and jet production 
which are estimated from data control samples limits are set on the parameters of the constrained 
minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model these limits extend those set previously by 
experiments at the tevatron and lep colliders

introduction 
the standard model sm of particle physics has been extremely 
successful in describing phenomena at the highest energies attained thus far nevertheless it is widely believed to be only an 
effective description of more complete theory which supersedes 
it at higher energy scales of particular theoretical interest is supersymmetry susy which solves the 
of the sm at the expense of introducing large number of 
supersymmetric particles with the same quantum numbers as the 
sm particles but differing by half unit of spin if conservation is assumed supersymmetric particles are produced 
in pairs and decay to the lightest supersymmetric particle lsp if 
the lsp is neutral and it goes undetected giving 
rise to signature with missing energy 
experiments at the energy frontier at the fermilab 
tron collider and previously at the cern spps 
hera and lep colliders have performed extensive 
searches for signs of susy in the absence of positive signal 
lower limits on the masses of susy particles have been set with 
its higher energy of tev the large hadron collider lhc at cern could produce susy particles sparticles with 
masses larger than the current limits the dominant production 
channels of heavy coloured sparticles at the lhc are 
squark and pair production in the 

context of susy with conservation heavy squarks and 
gluinos decay into quarks gluons and other sm particles as well 
as neutralino the lsp which escapes undetected leading 
to states with several hadronic jets and large missing transverse energy while production usually leads to two 
jets gluino production typically results in higher jet multiplicities 
this letter describes search for the production and decay of susy 
particles by the cms experiment in events with two or more energetic jets and imbalance of transverse energy 
the search is not optimized in the context of any particular 
model of susy to interpret the results and practical 
model of the constrained minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model cmssm is used the 
cmssm is described by parameters the universal scalar and 
gaugino mass parameters and respectively the universal trilinear soft susy breaking parameter and two

an in excess of gev thus providing 
high signal for the region of the cmssm parameter space 
relevant for the present search where squarks and gluinos have 
masses of several hundred gev additionally events are required 
to have at least one good reconstructed pp interaction vertex 
jets are reconstructed from the energy deposits in the 
calorimeter towers clustered by the algorithm with 
size parameter of in this process the contribution from each 
calorimeter tower is assigned momentum the magnitude and 
direction of which are given by the energy measured in the tower 
and the coordinates of the tower the raw jet energy is obtained 
from the sum of the tower energies and the raw jet momentum 
by the vectorial sum of the tower momenta resulting in nonzero 
jet mass the raw jet energies are corrected to establish relative 
uniform response of the calorimeter in and calibrated absolute response in transverse momentum the uncertainty on the 
energy scale of these corrected jets varies between and depending on the jet and the jets considered in this 
analysis are required to have gev and to pass 
jet criteria designed to reject spurious signals in 
the calorimeters the pseudorapidity of the jet with the highest 
leading jet is required to be within and the transverse 
energy of each of the two leading jets must exceed gev 
events with jets passing the threshold but not satisfying the 
jet criteria or the acceptance requirement are vetoed as this deposited energy is not accounted for in the event 
kinematics similarly events in which an isolated lepton electron or muon with gev is are rejected 
to suppress events with genuine missing energy from neutrinos 
furthermore to select pure multijet topology events are vetoed 

in which an isolated photon with gev is found these 
vetoes reject of the previously selected events in data and simulation 
at this preselection stage the background from multijet production as predicted by quantum chromodynamics qcd is still 
several orders of magnitude larger than the typical signal expected 
from susy the distribution for the selected events is shown 
in fig and compared to background estimates 
the qcd multijet background is estimated using the 
monte carlo generator with tune electroweak backgrounds 
from jets jets and jets events which will be 
referred to collectively as the electroweak ewk backgrounds in 
what follows are simulated using madgraph the sm distribution the sum of the qcd multijet and ewk distributions is

susy signal points and are overlaid with the exception 
of the sm processes fall off exponentially over the entire 
range whereas broad peak at values of few hundred of gev is 
expected for the signal models the selection is tightened by requiring the of all jets to exceed gev thus ensuring large 
hadronic activity in the event this requirement substantially reduces the contributions from sm processes while maintaining

the total background can be estimated from two control regions at low the region which contains events with 
between and gev and the region which contains events with between and gev given the current 
experimental limits on the squark and gluino masses these two 
regions are expected to be dominated by sm processes the search 
region for the signal which is referred to as the region in 
what follows is as events with gev 
the method is based on the variable as the ratio 
of the number of events passing and failing requirement on 
given all other selection requirements to minimize the 
bias arising from the phase space reduction in the lower regions the thresholds for the two bins are adjusted to keep 
the ratio of constant in each region in the region 
the resulting thresholds are gev for the two leading jets and 
gev for additional jets in the region the respective 
thresholds are and gev in the absence of susy signal 
the ratio can then be extrapolated from the measured values 
in both control regions to predict the value in the signal region

systematic uncertainty for this method is estimated by varying 
the relative magnitude of the three ewk processes while maintaining the dependence of each process to the one predicted 
by the monte carlo the background estimate is insensitive to 
this variation since the change in the estimate is always 
much smaller than the statistical uncertainty even under extreme 
variations of the individual ewk processes by up to times 
higher values than those predicted by simulation the systematic 
uncertainty is at least factor two smaller than the statistical uncertainty the same comments hold for the background estimate 
variants described below 
for comparison fig shows the expectation of if 
susy signal from each of the two benchmark points and 
were present in addition to the sm backgrounds the signal 
is predominantly visible in the region especially for 
which has larger squark and gluino masses there is nevertheless 
sizeable signal in the control region as well this contamination of the control region by potential signal is taken into 
account in the limit calculation section and both benchmark 
points are ruled out with level of or higher section 
variant of this background estimation method relies on the 
measurement in the bin only and uses small correction from mc simulation to predict in the signal region 

this variant results in an estimate of 
stat 
events another variant also based on the independence of 
on when the data sample is dominated by ewk processes 
for uses the weighted average of the values measured in the two control regions this value is then also 
used in the signal region to obtain background estimate of 
within uncertainties the three estimates are in agreement furthermore in the simulation all methods are shown to provide an unbiased estimator of the number of 
total background events for the remainder of this letter the result of the method which relies entirely on measured data 
and makes the most conservative assumption on the evolution 
of the double ratio with is used to estimate the total background 
jets and background 
second background estimation method uses an independent 
selection of jets events in the data in order to assess the contribution from sm processes with genuine 
the 
jets are selected as described in with an energetic and isolated muon in the state and by requiring the 
transverse mass of the to be larger than gev to ensure 
very pure sample originating from jets and the muons 
are required to be separated from the jets in the event by distance larger than in the plane since implies 

only events with gev are considered in the 
signal region in the lower regions this requirement is 
scaled accordingly to 
gev for 
in the region this selection yields events in agreement with the events predicted by the simulation in the 
region candidates are reconstructed in 
agreement with the prediction of events 
the fraction of jets events with in the data 
is also in good agreement with the simulation seven data events 
are found in the signal region compared with events 
predicted whereas events in the data pass the 
requirement in the region compared to 
events expected 
the number of jets and events satisfying the hadronic 

state selection of section data can be estimated from 



the number of events in the muon sample data and the expected relative ratio of these two types of events the value of 
this ratio is taken from monte carlo simulation which yields

on the for vetoing leptons 
jets background 
the remaining irreducible background stems from jets 
events an estimate of this background can be obtained from 
jets events which have larger production cross section but 
kinematic properties similar to those of jets events when 
the photon is ignored these jets events provide measurement of the acceptance of the requirement directly 
from data the jets sample is selected by requiring photons 
localized electromagnetic depositions satisfying very tight isolation criteria with gev and with distance 
in the plane to any jet larger than subsequently the 
photon is ignored and the same hadronic state selection as 
described in section is applied as in section 
is required 
to exceed gev this selection yields seven events in the data 
compared with expected from simulation the relative 
acceptances together with the appropriate ratio of cross sections 
for jets and jets taken from simulation are then 
used to estimate the number of jets events in the 
nal region found to be jets

the main systematic uncertainties arise from the ratio of cross sections between jets and jets in the simulation 
the for photon and the purity of the 
photon selection which add up to 
to check the validity of this uncertainty estimate the number of jets events can also be used to predict the number of jets events ten jets events are observed with 
gev jets and in agreement with

assigned systematic uncertainties is adequate

background estimate summary 
the sm backgrounds to this analysis have been evaluated with 
independent data control samples first from the lower regions in the data prediction for the total sm background of

then with jet control sample contribution of 


stat events from the combination of jets 
and processes is estimated finally with the jets sample 
the background from jets events is estimated to be

ter all selection requirements the data are compared with the sm 
background expectation along with two susy benchmark points 
the shape and magnitude of the eff distribution observed in the 
data are consistent with the expectation from the sm backgrounds 
the yields expected from the and benchmark susy models are in excess of the data over most of the eff range 
both these variables exhibit differences between susy signal 
events and events from sm backgrounds and could therefore be 
used to improve the limits extracted in the following section we 
have chosen not to do so because the current search has been optimized for the demonstration of potential new signal rather than 
for the extraction of the most stringent limits in the susy parameter space 
in summary events are observed in the data yield consistent within the uncertainties with the expectation from the sm 
processes in addition the kinematic properties of these events are 
consistent with the ewk backgrounds with negligible contribution from qcd multijet processes 
interpretation of the result 
method and limit on signal yield 
the background estimation methods described in the previous 
section are combined to provide an estimate of the total number 
of background events this estimate is found to be compatible with 
the number of events selected an upper limit on the number of 
events consistent with the measurements is derived using 
the method which is generalized to take 
into account nuisance parameters by using the likelihood 
ratio the input to the method is the total likelihood 
function total for the measurements in the control and signal regions to construct this likelihood function the numbers of events 
observed in the signal region and in each of the control samples 
are treated as independent experiments the total 
likelihood function can be written as

the potential effect of multiple interactions per bunch crossing

summary 
the search for supersymmetry in events collected by the 
cms experiment from collisions at 
energy of tev has been presented the states with two or 
more hadronic jets and missing transverse energy as 
expected from squark and gluino production and decays have been analysed in data corresponding to an integrated 
luminosity of search for susy signal has been performed at high values of the scalar sum of the transverse energy 
of jets the primary background from qcd multijet events 
has been reduced by several orders of magnitude down to negligible level using robust set of requirements designed 
for the exploratory early phase of the experiment the 
sum of standard model backgrounds has been estimated from an 
extrapolation of the data observed at lower values the only 
remaining backgrounds have been found to stem from electroweak 
processes namely jet jet and production where the 
weak decays of the vector bosons involve neutrinos an independent estimate of the electroweak backgrounds 
from jets decays as well as jets events in the data 
together with input from simulation has been found to be well 
compatible with the estimate from control samples in data here 
conservatively large systematic uncertainties have been assigned 
to the background estimates the measurements are in agreement 
with the expected contributions from standard model processes 
limits on the cmssm parameters have been derived and have 
been shown to improve those set by previous experiments

introduction 

supersymmetry susy is preferred candidate for theory 
beyond the standard model sm because it solves the hierarchy 
problem allows the of the gauge couplings and may 
provide candidate particle for dark matter the tev 
energy of the large hadron collider lhc makes 
it possible to search for squark and gluino production in previously unexplored regions of supersymmetric parameter space with 
the integrated luminosity delivered in the few months of 
operation hadronic collisions yielding three or more electrons 
muons or taus serve as an ideal hunting ground 
for physics beyond the sm as leptonic sm processes are relatively 
rare at hadron colliders and multilepton events particularly so 
we report results from search with broad sensitivity to the 
potentially large multilepton signals from susy particle production 
our strategy takes advantage of the strong background suppression obtained when requiring three or more leptons this allows 
us to relax requirements for sm background reduction relative to 
other searches with fewer leptons or purely hadronic searches at 
the lhc

the multilepton search presented here is not tailored for any 
particular susy scenario nonetheless it probes multiple new regions of the supersymmetric parameter space beyond previous 
multilepton searches at the tevatron overall this search 
complements the tevatron searches which are mostly sensitive 
to electroweak gaugino production while this search is mostly 
sensitive to production as in the case of tevatron 
searches we interpret results in the scenario of supersymmetry in which the superpartner masses and 
gauge couplings become at the grand scale 
resulting in common masses for all spin superpartners at this scale the remaining cmssm parameters are 
tan and for illustration we cmssm benchmark 
point called characterised by 
tan and order nlo cross section of pb for all supersymmetric processes 
in this letter we also study scenarios with gravitinos as the 
lightest supersymmetric particle lsp and sleptons as the supersymmetric particles nlsps scenarios of this type 
arise in wide class of theories of gauge mediation with split messengers gmsm multilepton states arise naturally in 
the subset of the gmsm parameter space where the 
sleptons are the slepton scenario we slepton benchmark point

the data sample used in this search corresponds to the integrated luminosity of recorded in with the compact 
muon solenoid cms detector at the lhc running at tev energy the cms detector has cylindrical symmetry around 
the pp beam axis with tracking and muon detector pseudorapidity 
coverage to where ln and is the polar 
angle with respect to the counterclockwise beam the azimuthal 
angle is measured in the plane perpendicular to the beam direction charged particle tracks are with fully 
tracking system composed of pixel detector with 
three barrel layers at radii between cm and cm and silicon strip tracker with barrel detection layers of which four are 
double sided extending outwards to radius of each system 
is completed by endcaps extending the acceptance of the tracker 
up to pseudorapidity of the scintillating 
crystal electromagnetic calorimeter ecal and 
hadron calorimeter hermetically surrounding the tracking system

subdetectors are placed inside long and diameter superconducting solenoid with central of outside the 
magnet is the of the hadronic calorimeter followed by 
the instrumented iron return yoke which serves as multilayered 
muon detection system in the range the cms detector 
has extensive forward calorimetry extending the pseudorapidity 
coverage to the performance of all detector components 
as measured with cosmic rays has been reported in ref and 
references therein much more detailed description of cms can 
be found elsewhere 
event trigger 
the data used for this search came from and doublelepton triggers the and high level trigger hlt of the cms trigger were adapted to changing beam 
conditions and increasing lhc luminosities during data collection for example the transverse momentum threshold for 
the unprescaled single muon trigger was raised from 
to near the end of data taking the analogous single 
electron trigger went from transverse energy threshold 
of gev in the early part of data taking to gev doublelepton trigger thresholds were set at for muons and 
gev for electrons 
the of the triggers are determined 
with the technique events with boson decays into 
two electrons or muons are selected by requiring one lepton and 
another track as lepton candidate with an invariant mass in the 
window of to the fraction of probed tracks 
that are reconstructed correctly as leptons including the trigger 
requirements determines the lepton the average trigger determined for is for the 
electrons and for the muons 
lepton 
leptons in this search can be either electrons muons or taus 
electrons and muons are selected with 
and 
as reconstructed from measured quantities from the tracker 

calorimeter and muon system since large fraction of the data 
set was collected with the highest trigger threshold implemented 
at high luminosity we require at least one muon with 
or an electron with gev the matching candidate tracks must satisfy quality requirements and spatially match with the energy deposits in the ecal and the tracks 
in the muon detectors as appropriate details of reconstruction 
and can be found in ref for electrons and in 
ref for muons jets are reconstructed using particles with 
via the pf algorithm as described in 
ref 
although the reconstruction of taus presents challenges we include these because there are regions of parameter space where 
signatures that include taus are enhanced taus decay either leptonically or hadronically the electrons or muons from the leptonic 
decays are as above the hadronic decays yield either 
single charged track decays or three charged tracks 
decays with or without additional electromagnetic 
energy from neutral pion decays we explore two strategies for 
hadronic decay reconstruction in this search and combine the results in the end in the selection the hadronic 
decays are reconstructed as isolated tracks with in 
the second selection hadronic decays are reconstructed with the 
pf algorithm which also includes the decays 
and decays with associated ecal activity this algorithm 
an signal cone in the region around the 
candidate track with an angular radius 

of gev jet this is limited to the range 


inside the signal cone one or three charged 
tracks are required pf tau candidates that are also electron or 
muon candidates are explicitly rejected 
these two algorithms have complementary isolated 
tracks originating from decays make up only about 
of hadronic tau decays but have relatively low backgrounds additionally some electrons and muons that fail normal requirements 
described above are accepted with the isolated track reconstruction the pf algorithm reconstructs all hadronic tau decays including the decays necessitating tighter 
kinematic requirements for some event topologies after event 
selection the tau channel are similar for both selections 
sources of background leptons include genuine leptons occurring inside or near jets hadrons simulating leptons by punchthrough into the muon system hadronic showers with large electromagnetic fractions or photon conversions an isolation requirement strongly reduces the background from leptons 
since most of them occur inside jets we the relative isolation rel as the ratio of the sum of calorimeter energy and 
of any other tracks in the cone by around the 
lepton to the of the lepton for electrons muons and isolated 
tracks we require rel for pf taus tracking and ecal isolation requirements are applied in the annular region between 
the signal cone and an isolation cone with 
leptons from susy decays considered in this search originate 
from the collision point leptons after the isolation selection the most background sources are residual nonprompt leptons from heavy quark decays where the lepton tends 
to be more isolated because of the high with respect to the 
jet axis this background is reduced by requiring that the leptons originate from within one centimeter of the primary vertex in and that the impact parameter dxy between the track 
and the event vertex in the plane transverse to the beam axis 
be small for electrons muons and isolated tracks the impact 
parameter requirement is dxy 
cm while dxy 
cm is 
required for pf taus the isolation and promptness criteria are

for the susy signal but almost eliminate leptons 
search strategy 
multilepton channels 
candidate events in this search must have at least three leptons 
of which at least one must be an electron or muon and may contain two or fewer hadronic tau candidates we classify multilepton 
events into search channels on the basis of the number of leptons 
lepton and relative charges as well as charge and 
combinations and other kinematic quantities described below 
we use the following symbols and conventions in describing 
the search the symbol 
stands for an electron or muon including those from tau decays in describing pairs of leptons os 
stands for ss for and sf for same lepton to explicitly denote differing lepton in pair 
we use the symbol 
the symbol refers to hadronic tau decays 
reconstructed using the pf tau algorithm and refers to decays 
reconstructed as isolated tracks 
the level of sm background varies considerably across the 
channels channels with hadronic tau decays or containing 
sf pairs suffer from large backgrounds but channels such 
as have smaller backgrounds because they do not contain 
pairs channels play two distinct roles in 
this search depending on the scenario of new physics for models that predict small signal yield in these channels they act 
as samples that give in predictions for the 
channels that have small background but it is also 
possible that new physics may preferentially manifest itself in the 
channels for example taus can greatly outnumber electrons and muons in the case of supersymmetry with large 
tan values therefore we retain channels such as those with two 
hadronic tau decays although they contribute only modestly to scenarios of new physics which we discuss later in comparison dilepton searches have higher backgrounds and are thus less sensitive 
to signals because of additional requirements necessary 
to reduce these backgrounds to manageable level we avoid using kinematic quantities such as tmiss or in datasets 
used in background determination such loose selection criteria 
minimize signal contamination between high and low background 
channels even for msugra scenarios the signal contamination is below 
background reduction 
other searches for new physics such as those requiring dileptons or single leptons suffer from large sm backgrounds and are 
hence forced to require substantial jet activity as well as missing 
transverse energy for the multilepton search described here the 
presence of third lepton results in lower sm backgrounds thus 
reducing reliance on other requirements and increasing sensitivity to diverse signatures of new physics the presence of hadronic 
activity in an event is characterised by the variable 
as the scalar sum of the transverse jet energies for all jets with 
gev and jets used for the determination 
must be well separated from any leptons jets are required to have no lepton in cone around the jet axis 
the missing transverse energy tmiss is as the magnitude 
of the vectorial sum of the momenta of all lepton candidates and 
jets with gev and comparison between data 
and simulation shows good modelling of tmiss 
both and tmiss are good discriminating observables for 
physics beyond the sm as demonstrated in fig in 

fig the top and tmiss bottom distributions for sm background channels 
jets and vv jets where and two susy benchmark points for 
the simulation events that pass all other requirements for the events 
the and benchmark points are in section and details of the 
simulation are given in section 

gions of parameter space one observable may be more effective 
than the other fig suggests that has slightly superior discriminating power for the models we happen to consider here 
on the other hand would be suppressed if the supersymmetric production were dominated by electroweak processes as 
would be the case at the tevatron another possibility is that 
the sparticle mass ordering in the supersymmetric particle spectrum may result in reduced participation of hadronic sparticles in 
the decay chain despite strong production resulting in negligible 
jet activity fig illustrates this situation showing the product 
of cross section branching fraction and event yield 
per unit integrated luminosity as function of the mass difference 
between the squark and lightest neutralino the slepton 
supersymmetric topology illustrated here has degenerate squarks 
with vanishing mixing and sleptons with 
masses of and respectively with variable lightest neutralino mass and other superpartners decoupled the 
shows that the requirement suppresses sensitivity when neutralino and squark masses are similar because squarks and gluinos 
fail to participate in the decay chain resulting in minimal hadronic 
activity by comparison tmiss is an appropriate discriminant in 
multilepton search because neutrino production generally accompanies and production nonetheless in order to retain 
search sensitivity beyond that of dilepton searches both tmiss and 
selections should be used as sparingly as possible the of the multichannel approach allows us to selectively impose 
the tmiss or requirements in channels doing so maximises sensitivity to new physics

fig effect of mass difference between squark and lightest neutralino on cross 
section times branching fraction times for an tmiss gev requirement red squares or for an gev requirement blue circles less hadronic 
energy is released if this difference becomes small so the requirement loses 
sensitivity in this region of parameter space the example is for channels containing two muons plus at least one electron or tau the slepton topology 
used here is described in the text for interpretation of the references to color in 
this legend the reader is referred to the web version of this letter 

we exploit the background reduction ability of both tmiss and 

as follows events with tmiss gev gev are said 

to satisfy the tmiss requirement the for the values chosen is evident from fig another criterion for background 
reduction is the in which the invariant mass of the 
lepton pairs is required to be outside the window 
possible source of background is from the state radiation in 
events undergoing conversion therefore the veto requirement is also applied to the invariant mass 
of three leptons for and events which have low 
tmiss and as described below these kinematic selection criteria are applied together or separately as warranted by the background level of the channel under consideration 
final kinematic selections 
in order to maximise sensitivity to diverse new physics scenarios we group the selections into two broadly complementary 
domains as the name suggests the hadronic selection makes 
uniform requirement gev it reduces backgrounds 
to practically negligible values for channels with electrons and 
muons both and hadronic tau decays are reconstructed using the pf technique for channels with 
pairs 
plus the residual background from jets is further reduced 
with the tmiss requirement tmiss gev only the background then remains nonnegligible about one event is expected 
in after the full selection 
the inclusive selection is based on the combined tmiss gev 
and requirements for events with an lepton pair 
these events also must satisfy to reject low 
mass production and the and resonances 
in addition candidate events are binned in exclusive channels 
characterised by total charge number of lepton candidates lepton high or low tmiss and whether the veto described 
above is or not isolated tracks are used to reconstruct the 
tau decays 
background estimation 
the main sm backgrounds in multilepton plus jet events originate from jets double vector boson production vv jets 

production and qcd multijets leptons associated with jets can 
be from heavy quark decays or with lower probability can 
be hadrons leptons from heavy quark decays are 
suppressed by the isolation requirement the probability that 
qcd event includes three leptons is negligible backgrounds from cosmic rays are also found to be negligible backgrounds from muons are included in the background 
estimate discussed below 
the largest background remaining after the basic 
reconstruction originates from the jets process which in our 
nomenclature includes the process as well the dileptons 
resulting from these processes together with isolated 
tracks give rise to trilepton background the probability that such 
an isolated track is as lepton is measured in control samples where no signal should be present such as in dijet 
samples we measure the probability for an isolated track to 
duce muon electron to be 

the sm background for the sample 
is then obtained by multiplying the number of isolated tracks in 
the sample by this probability in similar way we 
estimate the background for events by 
examining events with two additional isolated tracks 
the large systematic uncertainty on this rate is due to the difference in jet environment in qcd and jets control samples such 
differences are expected due to the variation of heavy quark content across the control samples 
for channels with isolated tracks we measure the sm background by using the isolation sideband rel to extrapolate to the signal region rel in order to improve the 
statistical error as well as to gain systematic understanding of 
the extrapolation process we study the isolation distribution in 
various qcd samples with different levels of jet activity and then 
evaluate the ratio of events in the two isolation regions in the qcd 
sample that most resembles the dilepton sample where the ratio 
is eventually applied the ratio of the numbers of isolated tracks 
in the two regions is measured to be the systematic uncertainty is derived from the extent of variation of the ratio 
in these qcd control samples the ratio is then applied to the 
event sample because the number of events after the tmiss selection is too small to be useful we derive the sm background in 
these channels by applying the isolation probability ratio as well 
as the probability of event to pass the tmiss selection to the 
full sample 
understanding of sm backgrounds at the selection 
level as above is essential before implementing the kinematic selections we perform detailed simulation of the detector response using for jets quark pairs 
and double vector boson production events generated using madgraph and qcd events generated with pythia we 
use parton distribution functions already at the 
dilepton level comparisons between data and simulation for distributions of the pair mass and for show good 
agreement for both muons and electrons fig shows the mass 
spectrum for dimuon events and the distribution for dielectron 
events after requiring third lepton the kinematic selections eliminate the jets background the and double vector 
boson backgrounds then come to the fore 
there is not data yet for estimate of 
the background so we use simulation with the contribution 
scaled to the measured cross section the background 
comes primarily from leptonic decays of both bosons accompanied by lepton from the jets in order to verify the adequacy of 
simulation for background estimation we examine the dilepton distribution since contributes dominantly to it in particular 
the spectrum of muons in this sample which fail isolation

quirements is described well by the simulation whether the muon 
originated promptly or not the same is true of nonisolated tracks 
agreement of these distributions with the simulation gives that the semileptonic branching fractions of the quark and 
semileptonic form factors are reproduced correctly by the simulation the vv jets channels include the irreducible background 
from wz jets with both vector bosons decaying leptonically and 
the neutrino yielding missing energy as well as from zz jets the 
simulation is used as these processes do include prompt leptons 
which are reasonably well described by simulation 
the lepton charge probability is generally less 
than for the lepton momenta typical for this search the databased background estimation techniques described above automatically account for charge background associated 
with the jets processes because the dilepton data sample used 
for multilepton background estimation contains events with charge 
the probability of acquiring wz trilepton events 
with total charge of three units because of charge 
is too small for the quantity of data considered here 
as the sm background events are binned in 
the isolation versus impact parameter plane the 
background in the signal region characterised by small isolation 
rel and impact parameters dxy cm is extrapolated from the three outside regions in this twodimensional plot by assuming the two variables rel and dxy to 
be uncorrelated so both can be independently extrapolated this 
technique presently suffers from large statistical uncertainties but the resulting background estimates are consistent 
with those described above 
in summary the nonprompt backgrounds from jets are 
measured from data and the methods described above successfully predict the number of events in data samples dominated 
by sm processes the backgrounds from and 
vv jets are then obtained from simulation with high 
observations

kinematic selections tau candidate is indicated by for an isolated track as proxy for hadronic tau decay and for the pf tau 
selection channels containing lepton pairs are listed separately because they suffer from larger sm background expectation the main sm backgrounds are given in the three columns 
followed by the total sm background which can be slightly larger 
than the sum of the previous columns since it includes less significant backgrounds such as those involving initial and state 
radiation columns for the inclusive and hadronic kinematic selections show the number of events surviving all requirements 
for the inclusive selection only the signal channels are shown 
which require tmiss gev and for 
events with an pair as discussed in section the control channels used in the limit setting are discussed in section 
for the hadronic selection the background reduction comes from 
the gev requirement the sum of the sm backgrounds 
mainly from and the irreducible vv jets backgrounds is given 
as well 
table also shows signal expectations for the slepton conlsp benchmark point described earlier all cross sections 
for the benchmark point and those used in the following exclusion plots include corrections calculated using prospino which yields factors in the range 
observations and sm expectations agree reasonably well we 
observe events worth noting an event 
with gev both the gev and tmiss 



fig events in data compared with the sm simulation top mass 
spectrum for bottom distribution for ee processes other than 
are too rare to be visible in these distributions 

gev requirements so does an event with 
gev event the gev requirement but not tmiss two events with tmiss of and 
gev fail the requirement the largest background in the 
channel is expected from events and one event is indeed 
selected as event in the cms top selection but the other 
fails the lepton requirement 
the 
row in table also merits discussion since 
we observe two events despite the sm expectation 
of only events one of the events is completely consistent 
with the zz hypothesis the zz invariant mass for 
this event is and it has negligible tmiss the second 
event is unlikely to be zz event but it contains pair 
with an invariant mass of which is too close to the 
mass to pass the veto criterion both events have small tmiss 
leptons originating from the same vertex and minimal other activity 
systematic uncertainties and statistical procedures 
we discuss the sources of systematic uncertainty and how they 
impact the search sensitivity before extracting upper limits on the 
contributions from physics outside the sm all channels share systematic uncertainties for luminosity renormalization scales 
parton distribution functions and trigger 
note that the luminosity uncertainty subsequently decreased to but the improvement does not have 
implications for this result the precision of lepton selection increases with lepton for typical slepton

signal scenario which has leptons with in excess of 
the lepton and isolation systematic uncertainty is per lepton for muons and electrons as well as for 
isolated tracks however cmssm signals result in lower leptons leading to higher systematic uncertainty on of 
per lepton for muons and for isolated tracks for 
electrons the systematic uncertainty on the isolation can 
be as large as because of effects of synchrotron radiation in 
the high cms solenoidal magnetic the uncertainty on the of pf tau is studied using comparison of 
events in data and simulation for this study events with 
muon plus hadronic tau decay are analysed yielding systematic uncertainty 
the impact of uncertainty from the jet energy scale for the 
selection is 
as determined by varying the requirement 
by the scale uncertainty has small effect 
on the signal since the signal is high given the jet energy requirements it varies in the range of where the larger 
number is for the tau modes 
sm backgrounds derived from data suffer from large systematic 
uncertainties because of the limited quantity of data in hand uncertainties on the rates are for the pf taus 
for tracks for muons and for electrons these 
uncertainties are derived from extensive studies in which rates are factorised into contributing components such 

as isolation and the factorised pieces are studied in different data sets although these uncertainties appear to be large 
they do not affect the results as the backgrounds are 
small the uncertainties on backgrounds derived from simulation 
are dominated by the uncertainty on the measured sm cross

we utilise the agreement between the expected sm backgrounds and observations shown in table to constrain new 
physics scenarios while being complementary in their approach 
the two kinematic selections overlap substantially this overlap 
must be removed in the combination of the two selections to

the statistical model uses poisson distribution for the number of events in each channel while the nuisance parameters

the nuisance parameters are the luminosity uncertainty

method with prior we check the stability of the result 
with respect to nuisance constraints selection by substituting lognormal constraints for the gaussian ones and the upper limit 
results to be stable within the statistical model is implemented 
in the program package roostats we apply these upper limits on the contribution of new physics for the following susy scenarios 
slepton 
in supersymmetry multilepton states arise naturally in the 
subset of gmsm parameter space where the sleptons 
are and at the bottom of the minimal supersymmetric standard model mssm mass spectrum the higgsinos are decoupled supersymmetric production proceeds mainly 
through pairs of squarks gluinos cascade decays of these 
states eventually pass sequentially through the lightest neutralino 
which decays into slepton and lepton 

although is often assumed to be conserved the most 
general formulation of the mssm superpotential contains 
violating couplings jk where and are generation indices 
we study models in which decays are allowed but baryon number is conserved so these models are not 
constrained by limits on proton lifetime which require both and 
violation 
events with four or more charged leptons in the state 
originate from the production of pairs of squarks or gluinos each 
of which cascade decays down to the lsp which in the model 
considered here is the neutralino each neutralino decays to two 
charged leptons and neutrino any nonzero value of jk causes 
the neutralino to decay yielding multilepton states the actual 
value of jk simply determines the lifetime and hence the decay 
length of the neutralino we consider jk to be large 
so that the decay is prompt the exclusion limits are independent 
of jk value and thus the search is sensitive only to the sparticle masses we consider the cases of nonzero and nonzero 
separately for the coupling the two charged leptons in 
each neutralino decay are electron muon while for 
one of the charged leptons is tau and the other an electron or 
muon 
the exclusion limits in the mass plane obtained using the inclusive kinematic selection are shown in the 
bottom panel of fig for topology with 

and with the wino and the higgsino 


decoupled the bumps in the contour plot are due to the fact that 
when the squark mass is larger than the gluino mass there are 
two additional jets in the event this lowers the of the 
lepton isolation requirement and therefore decreases the signal acceptance the limits for the coupling are lower because of 
the lower acceptance for taus these results substantially extend 
previous exclusion limits from cdf and based on integrated luminosities of 
scenario 
for the scenario limits in the 
plane are shown in fig for tan and the 
benchmark point above is close to the excluded limit 
from the tevatron data the total number of expected events after all cuts is for the data sample as can be seen 
our results extend the excluded region in comparison with previous results from lep and the tevatron for small values of 
the sleptons can become lighter than the gauginos so the gauginos will decay into slepton and lepton decay although 
for larger values of decays will dominate while for 
decays the branching fraction into leptons is it decreases rapidly for decays in the transition region from

the results of this search are consistent with sm expectations 
in the cmssm parameter space gluino masses up to 
are thus excluded for susy parameters this result is better 
than the prior multilepton results from the tevatron but is in the 
region already ruled out by other hadronic searches at the lhc 
however the following two regions of mssm are not accessible to hadronic searches with gravitinos as lsp and sleptons as 
we are able to exclude squark and gluino masses of up 
to and respectively we are also able to 
exclude models with leptonic violation for gluino masses

both cases our search extends into the regions of susy 
parameter space not accessible to multilepton searches at the tevatron
